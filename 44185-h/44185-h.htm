<h2><a name="chI" id="chI"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>THE CALL COMES TO BEAVER DAM</small></h2>

<p class="indent">BEAVER DAM was a farm; but
long before the day of John Starkley
and his wife, Constance Emma,
who lived there with their five children, the
name had been applied to and accepted by
a whole settlement of farms, a gristmill, a
meetinghouse, a school and a general store.
John Starkley was a farmer, with no other
source of income than his wide fields.
Considering those facts, it is not to be
wondered at that his three boys and two
girls had been bred to an active, early-rising,
robust way of life from their early
childhood.</p>

<p class="indent">The original human habitation of Beaver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
Dam had been built of pine logs by John&#39;s
grandfather, one Maj. Richard Starkley,
and his friend and henchman, Two-Blanket
Sacobie, a Malecite sportsman from the big
river. The present house had been built
only a few years before the major&#39;s death,
by his sons, Peter and Richard, and a son
of old Two-Blanket, of hand-hewn timbers,
whipsawn boards and planks and hand-split
shingles. But the older house still
stands solid and true and weather-tight on
its original ground; its lower floor is a tool
house and general lumber room and its upper
floor a granary.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon after the completion of the new
house the major&#39;s son Richard left Beaver
Dam for the town of St. John, where he
found employment with a firm of merchants
trading to London, Spain and the
West Indies. He was sent to Jamaica; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
from that tropic isle he sent home, at one
time and another, cases of guava jelly and
&quot;hot stuff,&quot; a sawfish&#39;s saw and half a dozen
letters. From Jamaica he was promoted
to London; and as the years passed, his
letters became less and less frequent until
they at last ceased entirely. So much for
the major&#39;s son Richard.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter stuck to the farm. He was a big,
kind-hearted, quiet fellow, a hard worker,
a great reader of his father&#39;s few books.
He married the beautiful daughter of a
Scotchman who had recently settled at
Green Hill&mdash;a Scotchman with a red beard,
a pedigree longer and a deal more twisted
than the road to Fredericton, a mastery of
the bagpipes, two hundred acres of wild
land and an empty sporran. Of Peter
Starkley and his beautiful wife, Flora,
came John, who had his father&#39;s steadfastness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
and his mother&#39;s fire. He went farther
afield for his wife than his father had gone&mdash;out
to the big river, St. John, and down
it many miles to the sleepy old village and
elm-shaded meadows of Gagetown. It
was a long way for a busy young farmer to
go courting; but Constance Emma Garden
was worth a thousand longer journeys.</p>

<p class="indent">When Henry, the oldest of the five
Starkley children, went to college to study
civil engineering, sixteen-year-old Peter,
fourteen-year-old Flora, twelve-year-old
Dick and eight-year-old Emma were at
home. Peter, who was done with school,
did a man&#39;s work on the farm; he owned a
sorrel mare with a reputation as a trotter,
contemplated spending the next winter in
the lumber woods and planned agriculture
activities on a scale and of a kind to astonish
his father.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
On a Saturday morning in June Dick
and Flora, who were chums, got up even
earlier than usual. They breakfasted by
themselves in the summer kitchen of the
silent house, dug earthworms in the rich
brown loam of the garden and, taking their
fishing rods from behind the door of the
tool house, set out hurriedly for Frying
Pan River. When they were halfway to
the secluded stream they overtook Frank
Sacobie, the great-grandson of Two-Blanket
Sacobie, who had helped Maj. Richard
Starkley build his house.</p>

<p class="indent">The young Malecite&#39;s black eyes lighted
pleasantly at sight of his friends, but his
lips remained unsmiling. He was a very
thin, small-boned, long-legged boy of thirteen,
clothed in a checked cotton shirt and
the cut-down trousers of an older Sacobie.
He did not wear a hat. His straight black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
hair lay in a fringe just above his eyebrows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn&#39;t you bring any worms?&quot; asked
Flora.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nope,&quot; said Frank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or any luncheon?&quot; asked Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nope,&quot; said Frank. &quot;You two always
fetch plenty worms and plenty grub.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He led the way along a lumbermen&#39;s
winter road, and at last they reached the
Frying Pan. Baiting their hooks, they
fell to fishing.</p>

<p class="indent">The trout were plentiful in the Frying
Pan; they bit, they yanked, they pulled.
The three young fishers heaved them ashore
by main force and awkwardness&mdash;as folk
say round Beaver Dam&mdash;and by noon the
three had as many fish as they could comfortably
carry. So, winding up their lines,
they washed their hands and sat down in
a sunny place to lunch. All were wet, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
all had fallen into the river more than once.
Dick had his left hand in a bandage by that
time; he had embedded a hook in the fleshy
part of it and had dug it out with his jack-knife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s nothing! Just a scratch!&quot; he
said in the best offhand military manner.
&quot;My great-grandfather once had a Russian
bayonet put clean through his shoulder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guess my great-gran&#39;father did some
fightin&#39;, too,&quot; remarked Frank Sacobie.
&quot;He was a big chief on the big river.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he didn&#39;t,&quot; said Dick. &quot;He was a
chief, all right; but there wasn&#39;t any fighting
on the river in his day. He was Two-Blanket
Sacobie. I&#39;ve read all about him
in my great-grandfather&#39;s diary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t mean him,&quot; said Frank. &quot;I
mean Two-Blanket&#39;s father&#39;s father&#39;s
father. His name was just Sacobie, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
his mark was a red canoe. He fought the
English and the Mohawks. All the Malecites
on the big river were his people, and
he was very good friend to the big French
governors. The King of France sent him
a big medal. My gran&#39;mother told me all
about it once. She said how Two-Blanket
got his name because he sold that medal to
a white man on the Oromocto for two blankets;
and that was a long time ago&mdash;way
back before your great-gran&#39;father ever
come to this country. I tell you, if I want
to be a soldier, I bet I would make as good
a soldier as Dick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bet you wouldn&#39;t,&quot; retorted Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right. I&#39;m goin&#39; to be a soldier&mdash;and
you&#39;ll see. I&#39;m going into the militia
as soon as I&#39;m old enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So&#39;m I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flora laughed. &quot;Who will you fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
with you when you are in the militia?&quot; she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">The boys exchanged embarrassed glances.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess the militia could fight all right
if it had to,&quot; said Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it could,&quot; said Frank.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">For four years after the conversation
that took place on the bank of Frying Pan
River Flora and Dick and the rest of the
Starkley family except Henry lived on in
the quiet way of the folk at Beaver Dam.
The younger children continued to go daily
to school at the Crossroads, to take part
in the lighter tasks of farm and house, to
play and fish and argue and dream great
things of the future.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter spent each winter in the lumber
woods. In his nineteenth year he invested
his savings in a deserted farm near Beaver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
Dam and passed the greater part of the
summer of 1913 in repairing the old barn
on his new possession, cutting bushes out of
the old meadows, mending fences and clearing
land.</p>

<p class="indent">That was only a beginning he said. He
would own a thousand acres before long
and show the people of Beaver Dam&mdash;including
his own father&mdash;how to farm on a
big scale and in an up-to-date manner.</p>

<p class="indent">Henry, the eldest Starkley of this generation,
had completed his course at college
and got a job with a railway survey party
in the upper valley of the big river. He
proved himself to be a good engineer.</p>

<p class="indent">In the spring of 1914 Frank Sacobie, now
seventeen years of age, left Beaver Dam to
work in a sawmill on the big river. Peter
Starkley invested his winter&#39;s wages in another
mare, two cows and a ton of chemical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
fertilizers. He ploughed ten acres of his
meadows and sowed five with oats, four to
buckwheat, and planted one to potatoes.
The whole family was thrilled with the romance
of his undertaking. His father
helped him to put in his crop; and Dick
and Flora found the attractions of Peter&#39;s
farm irresistible. The very tasks that they
classed as work at home they considered as
play when performed at &quot;Peter&#39;s place.&quot;
In the romantic glow of Peter&#39;s agricultural
beginning Dick almost resigned his
military ambitions. But those ambitions
were revived by Peter himself; and this is
how it happened.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter planned to raise horses, and he
felt that the question what class of horse to
devote his energies to was very important.
One day late in June he met a stranger in
the village of Stanley, and they &quot;talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
horse.&quot; The stranger advised Peter to
visit King&#39;s County if he wanted knowledge
on that subject.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Enlist in the cavalry,&quot; he said&mdash;&quot;the
8th, Princess Louise, New Brunswick Hussars.
That will give you a trip for
nothin&#39;&mdash;two weeks&mdash;and a dollar a day&mdash;and
a chance to see every sort of horse that
was ever bred in this province, right there
in the regiment. Bring along a horse of
your own, and the government will pay you
another dollar a day for it&mdash;and feed it. I
do it every year, just for a holiday and a bit
of change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It sounded attractive to Peter, and two
weeks later he and his black mare set off for
King&#39;s County to join the regiment in its
training camp. In his absence Dick and
Flora looked after the sorrel mare, his cows
and his farm. Two weeks later Peter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
the mare returned; the mare was a little
thinner than of old, and Peter was full of
talk of horses and soldiering. Dick&#39;s military
ambitions relit in him like an explosion
of gunpowder.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came word of the war to Beaver
Dam.</p>

<p class="indent">The folk of Beaver Dam, and of thousands
of other rural communities, were
busy with their haying when Canada
offered a division to the mother country, for
service in any part of the world. Militia
officers posted through the country, seeking
volunteers to cross the ocean and to
bear arms against terrific Germany.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter, now in his twentieth year, wished
to join.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what about your new farm and all
your great plans?&quot; asked John Starkley.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick and I will look after his farm for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
him,&quot; said Flora. &quot;We can harvest his
crops and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then she looked at her mother and
suddenly became silent. Mrs. Starkley&#39;s
face was very white.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the need for men from Canada is
great, other divisions will be called for,&quot;
said the father. &quot;At present, only one division
has been asked for&mdash;and I think
that can easily be filled with seasoned
militiamen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some one drove past the window!&quot; exclaimed
Flora.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened and a young man, in
the khaki service uniform of an officer, entered
the room. He halted, removed his
cap and grinned broadly at the astonished
family.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Henry!&quot; cried Mrs. Starkley, pressing
a hand swiftly and covertly to her side.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Her husband found nothing to say just
then. Dick and Flora and Emma ran to
Henry and began asking questions and examining
and fingering his belt, the leather
strapping of his smart riding breeches,
even his high, brown boots and shining
spurs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you, Henry?&quot; asked Flora.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A sapper&mdash;an engineer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you an officer?&quot; asked Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lieutenant, 1st Field Company, Canadian
Engineers&mdash;that&#39;s what I am. Hope
you approve of my boots.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going, Henry?&quot; asked Peter,
with a noticeable hitch in his voice and a
curious expression of disappointment and
relief in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I&#39;m to join my unit at the big mobilization
camp in Quebec in ten days,&quot; replied
Henry.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
John Starkley put a hand on Peter&#39;s
shoulders. &quot;Then you will wait, Peter,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re needed here&mdash;and we must keep
you as long as we can. One at a time is
enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll wait now, but I will go with the next
lot,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">Henry had nine days in which to arrange
his affairs, and no affairs to arrange. He
was in high spirits and proud of his commission,
but he put on an old tweed suit
the next morning and helped with the last
of the haying on the home farm and on
Peter&#39;s place. When the nine days were
gone he donned his uniform again and
drove away to the nearest railway station
with his mother and father and little
Emma. He wrote frequent entertaining
letters from the big camp at Valcartier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
On the 29th day of September he
embarked at Quebec; the transports
gathered in Gaspé Basin and were joined
there by their escort of cruisers; the great
fleet put out to sea&mdash;the greatest fleet that
had ever crossed the Atlantic&mdash;bearing
thirty-three thousand Canadian soldiers to
the battlefields of Europe instead of the
twenty thousand that had been originally
promised.</p>

<p class="indent">At Beaver Dam Peter worked harder
than ever, but with a look in his eyes at
times that seemed to carry beyond the job
in hand. A few weeks ago he had experienced
a pardonable glow of pride and self-satisfaction
when people had pointed him
out as the young fellow who had bought
the old Smith place and who was going to
farm in a big way; now it seemed to him
that the only man worth pointing out was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
the man who had enlisted to fight the
swarming legions of Germany.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not invest in any more live stock
that fall. He sold all of the oats and straw
that he did not need for the wintering of his
two mares and two cows. He did not look
for a job in the lumber woods. His
potatoes were a clean and heavy crop; and
he went to Stanley to sell them. That was
early in October.</p>

<p class="indent">The storekeeper there was a man named
Hammond, who dealt in farm produce on
a large scale and who shipped to the cities
of the province. He engaged to take
Peter&#39;s crop at a good price, then talked
about the war. One of his sons, a lieutenant
in the militia, had sailed with the first
contingent. They talked of that young
man and Henry and others who had gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am off with the next lot,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
&quot;That will be soon enough,&quot; said the merchant
thoughtfully. &quot;My daughter, Vivia,
has been visiting in Fredericton, and she
tells me there is talk of a second division
already. Jim says he is going with the next
lot, too. That will leave me without a son
at all, but I haven&#39;t the face to try to talk
him out of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter accepted an invitation to have
dinner with the Hammonds. He knew the
other members of the family slightly&mdash;Mrs.
Hammond, Vivia and Jim. Jim, who was
a year or two older than Peter, was a thickset,
dull-looking young man with a reputation
as a shrewd trader. He was his
father&#39;s chief assistant in the business.
Patrick, the son who had sailed with the
first contingent, had a reputation as a fisherman
and hunter, which meant that he was
considered as frivolous and that he had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
standing at all as a business man. Vivia,
the daughter, resembled Patrick rather than
Jim. She was about seventeen years old.
Peter, who had not seen her for twelve
months, wondered how such a heavy duffer
as Jim Hammond came by such a sister.</p>

<p class="indent">During the meal Peter paid a great deal
of attention to everything Vivia Hammond
said, and Vivia did more talking than anyone
else at the table; and yet by the time
Peter was on the road for Beaver Dam he
could not remember a dozen words of all
the hundreds she had spoken. Likewise,
he attended her with his eyes as faithfully
as with his ears; and yet by the time he was
halfway home his mind&#39;s picture of her was
all gone to glimmering fragments. The
more he concentrated his thoughts upon her
the less clearly could he see her.</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed at himself. He could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
remember ever having been in a like difficulty
before. Well, he could afford to
laugh, for, after all, he lived within a
reasonable distance of her and could drive
over again any day if his defective memory
troubled him seriously. And that is
exactly what he did,&mdash;and on the very next
day at that,&mdash;&mdash;half believing even himself
that he went to talk about enlisting, and the
war in general, with her heavy brother.
He did not see Jim on that occasion, and
during a ten-minutes&#39; interview with Vivia
he did not say more than a dozen words.</p>

<p class="indent">On the 4th of November Peter read in the
Fredericton Harvester that recruiting had
begun in the city of St. John for the 26th
Infantry Battalion, a newly authorized unit
for overseas service. The family circle at
Beaver Dam sat up late that night. Peter
talked excitedly, and the others listened in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
silence. Dick&#39;s eyes shone in the lamplight.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter drove over to Stanley early the next
morning and there took the train to Fredericton,
and from Fredericton to St. John.
He felt no military thrill. Loneliness and
homesickness weighed on him already&mdash;loneliness
for his people, for the wide home
kitchen and bright sitting-room, for his own
fields.</p>

<p class="indent">He reached the big city by the sea after
dark. The traffic of the hard streets, the
foggy lights and the heedless, hurrying
crowds of people added bewilderment to his
loneliness. With his baggage at his feet, he
stood in the station and gazed miserably
around.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter Starkley did not stand there unnoticed.
Dozens of the people who pushed
past him eyed him with interest and wondered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
what he was waiting for. He was so
evidently not of the city. He looked at
once rustic and distinguished. But no one
spoke to him until a sergeant in a khaki
service uniform caught sight of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t make you out,&quot; said the sergeant,
stepping up to him.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 473px;">
<a name="i035" id="i035"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i035.jpg" width="473" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;&#39;I CAN&#39;T MAKE YOU OUT,&#39; SAID THE SERGEANT.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can place you,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re a
sergeant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right,&quot; returned the other. &quot;And
you&#39;re from the country. Your big felt hat
tells me so&mdash;and your tanned face. But I
can see that you&#39;re a person of some importance
where you come from.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter blushed. &quot;I am a farmer and a
trooper in the 8th Hussars, and I have come
here to enlist for overseas with the new infantry
battalion,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s what I hoped!&quot; exclaimed the
sergeant. &quot;Come along with me, lad. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
are for the 26th Canadian Overseas Infantry
Battalion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant, whose name was Hammer,
was a cheery, friendly fellow. He was also
a very keen soldier and entertained a high
opinion of the military qualities of the new
battalion. On reaching the armory of the
local militia regiment, now being used as
headquarters of the new unit, Hammer led
Peter straight to the medical officer. The
doctor found nothing the matter with the
recruit from Beaver Dam. Then Hammer
paraded him before the adjutant. Peter
answered a few questions, took a solemn
oath and signed a paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you&#39;re a soldier, a regular soldier,&quot;
said the sergeant and slapped him on the
back. &quot;Come along now, and in half an
hour I&#39;ll have you fitted into a uniform as
trim as my own.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
Within a month Peter Starkley had distinguished
himself as a steady soldier; he
had attained to the rank of lance corporal,
and then of corporal. His steadiness was
largely owing to homesickness. Of his few
intimates the closest was Sergt. Hammer.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim Hammond did not join the regiment
until close upon Christmas. He was found
physically fit; and, as a result of a request
made by Peter to Hammer and by the sergeant
to Lieut. Scammell, and by the lieutenant
to the adjutant, he became a member
of the same platoon as Peter. Not only
that, he became one of Hammer&#39;s section,
in which Peter was a corporal.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter felt that he should like to be good
friends with Jim Hammond, but he did not
give a definite reason even to himself for
that wish. Jim, in his own person, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
not attractive to him. Peter felt misgivings
when Jim, within two days of donning his
uniform, began to grumble about the severity
of the training. Three days later Dave
Hammer, in his official capacity as a section
commander, fell upon Jim Hammond in
his official capacity as a private soldier.
Reason and justice, as well as authority,
were with the sergeant. Jim came to Peter
that evening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look a-here, who does Dave Hammer
think he is, anyhow?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess he knows who he is,&quot; replied
Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, whoever he is,&quot; Hammond declared
wrathfully, &quot;I won&#39;t be bawled out
by him. I guess I&#39;m as good a man as he is&mdash;and
better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll have lots of chances, from now
on, to show how good a man you are. Acting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
as you did on the route march this afternoon
doesn&#39;t show it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hammond&#39;s face darkened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that so?&quot; he retorted. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll tell
you now I didn&#39;t come soldiering to be
taught my business by you or any other
bushwhacker from Beaver Dam. You got
two stripes, I see. I&#39;d have two stars if I
took to licking people&#39;s boots the way you
do, Peter Starkley.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter bent forward, and his lean face
hardened, and his dark eyes glinted coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to have trouble with you,
Jim,&quot; he said, and his voice was no more
than a whisper, &quot;but it will happen if you
don&#39;t look out. I don&#39;t lick any man&#39;s
boots! If I hear another word like that
out of you, I&#39;ll lick something&mdash;and that
will be you! Do you get me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked dangerous. Hammond tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
to glare him down, but failed. Hammond&#39;s
own eyes wavered. He grunted
and turned away. The next morning he
applied for a Christmas pass, which was refused
on the ground that the men who had
joined first should be the first to receive
passes. He felt thoroughly ill-used.</p>

<h2><a name="chII" id="chII"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>JIM HAMMOND DOES NOT RETURN TO DUTY</small></h2>

<p class="indent">PETER STARKLEY got home to
Beaver Dam for New Year&#39;s Day
on a six days&#39; pass. Jim Hammond
had also tried to get a pass, but he had
failed. Peter found his homesickness increased
by those six days; but he made
every effort to hide his emotions. He
talked bravely of his duties and his comrades,
and especially of Dave Hammer.
He said nothing about Jim Hammond except
when questioned, and then as little as
possible.</p>

<p class="indent">He polished his buttons and badges every
morning and rolled his putties as if for
parade. The smartness of his carriage
gave a distinction even to the unlovely khaki
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
service uniform of a British noncommissioned
officer. He looked like a guardsman
and felt like a schoolboy who dreaded the
approaching term. He haunted the barns
and stables of the home farm and of his
own place and tramped the snow-laden
woods and blanketed fields. In spite of
his efforts to think only of the harsh and
foreign task before him, he dreamed of
clearings here and crops there. The keen,
kindly eyes of his parents saw through to
his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">One day of the six he spent in the village
of Stanley. He called first at Hammond&#39;s
store, where he tried to give Mr. Hammond
the impression that he had dropped in
casually, but as he had nothing to sell and
did not wish to buy anything he failed to
hoodwink the storekeeper. Mr. Hammond
was cordial, but seemed worried.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
He complimented Peter on his promotion
and his soldierly appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad you got home,&quot; he said. &quot;Wish
Jim could have come along with you, but
he writes as how they won&#39;t give him a
pass. Seems to me it ain&#39;t more than only
fair to let all the boys come home for Christmas
or New Year&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then there wouldn&#39;t be any one left to
carry on,&quot; said Peter. &quot;They&#39;ve fixed it
so that those who have been longest on the
job get the first passes; but I guess every one
will get home for a few days before we
sail.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jim says the training&mdash;the drill and all
that&mdash;is mighty hard,&quot; continued Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some find it so, and some don&#39;t,&quot; replied
Peter awkwardly. &quot;I guess it&#39;s what
you might call a matter of taste.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
&quot;Like enough,&quot; said the storekeeper,
scratching his chin. &quot;It&#39;s a matter of
taste&mdash;and not to Jim&#39;s taste, that&#39;s
sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter felt relieved to see that Mr. Hammond
seemed to understand the case. He
was about to elaborate on the subject of
military training when a middle-aged man
wearing a bowler hat and a fur-lined overcoat
turned from the counter. He had a
square, clean-shaven face and very bright
and active black eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse me, corporal,&quot; the stranger said,
&quot;but may I horn in and inquire what you
think of it yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can ask if you want to, Mr. Sill,&quot;
said Mr. Hammond, &quot;but you won&#39;t hear
any kick out of Peter Starkley, whether he
likes it or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s easier than working in the woods,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
either chopping or teaming,&quot; said Peter
pleasantly, &quot;and I&#39;ll bet a dollar it is a
sight easier than the real fighting will
be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the way to look at it, corporal,&quot;
said the stranger. &quot;I guess that in a war
like this a man has to make up his mind
to take the fun and the ferocity, the music
and the mud, and the pie and the pain,
just as they come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess so,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">The stranger shook his hand cordially
and just before he turned away remarked,
&quot;Maybe you and I will meet again sooner
than you expect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is he, and what&#39;s he driving at?&quot;
asked Peter, when the stranger had left
the store.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is a Yank, and a traveler for Maddock
&amp; Co. of St. John, and his name is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Hiram Sill&mdash;but I don&#39;t know what he is
driving at any more than you do,&quot; replied
Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">The storekeeper invited Peter to call
round at the house and to stay to dinner and
for as long as he liked afterwards. Peter
accepted the invitation. The Hammond
house stood beside the store, but farther back
from the road. It was white and big, with
a veranda in front of it, a row of leafless
maples, a snowdrifted lawn and a picket
fence. Vivia Hammond opened the door
to his ring. From behind the curtain of
the parlor window she had seen him approach.</p>

<p class="indent">At dinner Peter talked more than was
usual with him; something in the way the
girl listened to him inspired him to conversation.
At two o&#39;clock he accompanied her
to the river and skated with her. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
had such parts of the river as were not
drifted with snow to themselves, except for
two little boys. The little boys, interested
in Peter as a military man, kept them constantly
in sight. Peter felt decidedly hostile
toward those harmless boys, but he was
too shy to mention it to Vivia. He was delighted
and astonished when she turned
upon them at last and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Billy Brandon, you and Jack had better
take off your skates and go home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess we got as much right as anybody
on this here river,&quot; replied Billy Brandon,
but there was a lack of conviction in his
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were both in bed with grippe only
last week,&quot; Vivia retorted; &quot;but I&#39;ll call in
at your house and ask your mother about
it on my way up the hill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little boys had nothing to say to that.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
They maintained a casual air, skated in circles
and figures for a few minutes and then
went home. For ten minutes after that the
corporal and the girl skated in an electrical
silence, looking everywhere except at each
other. Then Peter ventured a slanting
glance across his left shoulder at her little
fur-cuddled face. Their eyes met.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Mrs. Brandon can&#39;t manage those
boys,&quot; she said. &quot;But they are very good
boys, really. They do everything I tell
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t they? But I&#39;m glad
they&#39;re gone, anyway,&quot; he replied, in a voice
that seemed to be tangled and strangled in
the collar of his greatcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">When Vivia and Peter returned to the
house the eastern sky was eggshell green
and the west, low along the black forests,
as red as the draft of a stove. Their conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
had never fully recovered after
the incident of the two little boys. Wonderful
and amazing thoughts and emotions
churned round in Peter&#39;s head and heart,
but he did not venture to give voice to them.
They bewildered him. He stayed to tea
and at that comfortable meal Mr. and Mrs.
Hammond did the talking. Vivia and
Peter looked at each other only shyly as if
they were afraid of what they might see in
each other&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Peter went to the barn and harnessed
the mare. Then he returned to the
house to say good night to the ladies. That
accomplished, Vivia accompanied him to
the front door. Beyond the front door, as
a protection against icy winds and drifting
snow, was the winter porch&mdash;not much bigger
than a sentry box. Stepping across the
threshold, from the warm hall into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
porch, Peter turned and clutched and held
the girl&#39;s hand across the threshold. The
tumult of his heart flooded up and smothered
the fear in his brain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never spent such a happy day in all
my life,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Vivia said nothing. And then the mischief
got into the elbow of the corporal&#39;s
right arm. It twitched; and, since his
right hand still clasped Vivia&#39;s hand, the
girl was jerked, with a little skip, right out
of the hall and into the boxlike porch.</p>

<p class="indent">Two seconds later Peter pulled open the
porch door and dashed into the frosty night.
He jumped into the pung, and away went
the mare as if something of her master&#39;s
madness had been communicated to her.
The corporal had kissed Vivia!</p>

<p class="indent">Peter returned to his battalion two days
later. In St. John he found everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
much as usual. Hammer was as brisk and
soldierly as ever, but Jim Hammond was
more sulky than before. Peter considered
the battalion with a new interest. Life,
even away from Beaver Dam, seemed more
worth while, and he went at his work with
a jump. He wrote twice a week to Vivia,
spending hours in the construction of each
letter and yet always leaving out the things
that he wanted most to write. The girl&#39;s
replies were the results of a similar literary
method.</p>

<p class="indent">The training of the battalion went on,
indoors and out, day after day. In March,
Jim Hammond went home for six days.
By that time he was known throughout the
battalion as a confirmed sulker. The six
days passed; the seventh day came and went
without sight or news of him, and then the
adjutant wired to Mr. Hammond. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
reply came from the storekeeper. Lieut.
Scammell questioned Peter about the family.
Peter told what he knew&mdash;that the
Hammonds were fine people, that one son
was an officer already in England, and that
the father was an honest and patriotic citizen.
So another wire was sent from the
orderly room. That, like the first, failed
to produce results.</p>

<p class="indent">The adjutant, Capt. Long, then sent for
Peter. This officer was not much more than
five feet high, despite the name of his
fathers, and was built in proportion. It
tickled the humor of the men to see such a
little fellow chase ten hundred bigger fellows
round from morning until night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are to go upriver and find out why
Private Hammond has not returned to
duty,&quot; said the captain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
&quot;Inform me by wire,&quot; continued the captain.
&quot;Use your brains. I am sending
you alone, because I want to give Hammond
a chance for the sake of his brother
overseas. Here are your pass, your railway
warrant and a chit for the paymaster.
That&#39;s all, Corp. Starkley.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter saluted and retired. He reached
Fredericton that night and the home village
of Jim Hammond by noon of the next
day. He went straight to the store, where
Mr. Hammond greeted him with astonishment.
Peter saw no sign of Jim.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t expect to see you back so soon,&quot;
said Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got a chance, so I took it,&quot; replied
Peter. &quot;How&#39;s all the family?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The storekeeper smiled. &quot;The womenfolk
are well,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter saw that he had come suddenly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
the point where he must exercise all the
tact he possessed. He felt keenly embarrassed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you get a telegram?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Did you wire us you were coming?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that, exactly. You see, it was like
this, Mr. Hammond: when Jim didn&#39;t get
back the day he was due the adjutant sent
you a wire, and when he didn&#39;t get an
answer he sent another&mdash;and when you
didn&#39;t reply to that he detailed me to come
along and see what was wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The storekeeper stared at him. &quot;I never
got any telegram. Jim came home on two
weeks&#39; furlough, and he has five days of it
left. You and your adjutant must be
crazy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two weeks,&quot; repeated Peter. &quot;It was
six days he got.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
&quot;Six days! Are you sure of that, Peter
Starkley?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As sure as that&#39;s my name, Mr. Hammond.
And the adjutant sent you two
telegrams, asking why Jim didn&#39;t return to
duty when his pass was up&mdash;and he didn&#39;t
get any answer. If you didn&#39;t get one or
other of those telegrams, then there is something
wrong somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hammond&#39;s face clouded. &quot;I didn&#39;t
get any wire, Peter&mdash;and Jim went away
day before yesterday, to visit some friends,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">They eyed each other in silence for a
little while; both were bitterly embarrassed,
and the storekeeper was numbed with
shame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll go for him,&quot; he said. &quot;If I fetch
him to you here, will you promise to&mdash;to
keep the truth of it quiet, Peter&mdash;from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
mother and sister and the folk about here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll do the best I can,&quot; promised the
corporal, &quot;but not for Jim&#39;s sake, mind you,
Mr. Hammond. Capt. Long is for giving
him a chance because of his brother, Pat,
over on Salisbury Plain&mdash;and that&#39;s why he
sent me alone, instead of sending a sergeant
with an escort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll go fetch him, Peter,&quot; said the other,
in a shaking voice. &quot;You go along to
Beaver Dam and come back to-morrow&mdash;to
see Vivia. When Jim and I turn up you
meet him just like it was by chance. Keep
your mouth shut, Peter. Not a word to a
living soul about his only having six days.
He&#39;s not well, and that&#39;s the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A dull anger was awake in Peter by this
time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something the matter with his feet,&quot; he
said and left the store.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
Here he was, told to be tactful by Capt.
Long and to keep his mouth shut by Mr.
Hammond, all on account of a sulky, lazy,
bad-tempered fellow who had been a disgrace
to the battalion since the day he
joined it. And not a word about stopping
for dinner!</p>

<p class="indent">He crossed the road to the hotel, made
arrangements to be driven out to Beaver
Dam and then ate a lonely dinner. He
thought of Vivia Hammond only a few
yards away from him, yet unconscious of
his proximity&mdash;and he wanted to punch the
head of her brother Jim. He drove away
from the hotel up the long hill without venturing
a glance at the windows of the big
white house on the other side of the road.</p>

<p class="indent">The family at Beaver Dam accepted his
visit without question. No mention was
made of Jim Hammond that night. Peter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
was up and out early the next morning, lending
a hand with the feeding and milking.</p>

<p class="indent">After breakfast he and Dick went over
to his own place to have a look at his house
and barns.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frank Sacobie came home last week,&quot;
said Dick. &quot;He&#39;s been out to see us twice.
He wants to enlist in your outfit, but I am
trying to hold him off till next year so&#39;s we
can go over together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You babies had better keep your bibs on
a few years longer,&quot; said Peter. &quot;I guess
there will be lots of time for all of you to
fight in this war without forcing yourselves
under glass.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They rounded a spur of spruces and saw
Sacobie approaching on snowshoes across
the white meadows. He had grown taller
and deeper in the chest since Peter had last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
seen him. The greeting was cordial but not
wordy. Sacobie turned and accompanied
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see Jim Hammond yesterday, out Pike
Settlement way,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That so?&quot; returned Peter, trying to
seem uninterested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No uniform on, neither, and drinkin&#39;
some,&quot; continued Sacobie. &quot;Says he&#39;s got
his discharge from that outfit because it
ain&#39;t reckoned as first-class and has
been asked to be an officer in another outfit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Peter forgot his instructions. Jim
Hammond too good for the 26th battalion!
Jim Hammond offered a commission! His
indignant heart sent his blood racing
through him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a liar!&quot; he cried. &quot;Yes, and a deserter,
too, by thunder!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
Dick was astonished, but Frank Sacobie
received the information calmly, without so
much as a flicker of the eyelids.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that all the time I listen to him,&quot;
he said. &quot;I figger to get his job, anyway,
if he lie or tell the truth. I go down to-morrow,
Peter, and you tell the colonel
how I make a darn sight better soldier than
Jim Hammond.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter gripped the others each by an
arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have said that,&quot; he cautioned
them. &quot;Forget it! You boys have got to
keep it under your hats, but I guess it&#39;s up
to me to take a jog out Pike Settlement way.
If you boys say a word about it, you get in
wrong with me and you get me in wrong
with a whole heap of folks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They turned and went back to Beaver
Dam. There they hitched the mares to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
big red pung and stowed in their blankets
and half a bag of oats.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t tell you where I&#39;m going or
what for, but only that it is a military duty,&quot;
said Peter in answer to the questions of the
family.</p>

<p class="indent">He took Dick and Frank Sacobie with
him. Once they got beyond the outskirts of
the home settlement they found heavy sledding.
At noon they halted, blanketed and
baited the mares, boiled the kettle and
lunched. The wide, white roadway before
them, winding between walls of green-black
spruces and gray maples, was marked with
only the tracks of one pair of horses and one
pair of sled runners&mdash;evidently made the
day before. Peter guessed them to be those
of Mr. Hammond&#39;s team, but he said nothing
about that to his companions.</p>

<p class="indent">Here and there they passed drifted clearings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
and little houses sending blue feathers
of smoke into the bright air. They came to
places where the team that had passed the
previous day had been stuck in the drifts and
laboriously dug out.</p>

<p class="indent">They were within two miles of the settlement,
between heavy woods fronted with
tangled alders, when the cracking <i>whang!</i>
of exploding cordite sounded in the underbrush.
The mares plunged, then stood.
The reins slipped from Peter&#39;s mittened
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m hit, boys!&quot; he said and then sagged
over across Dick&#39;s knees.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="i065" id="i065"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i065.jpg" width="700" height="426" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;&#39;I&#39;M HIT, BOYS!&#39; HE SAID.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">They laid him on hay and horse blankets
in the bottom of the pung and covered him
with fur robes. Then Sacobie got up in
front and drove.</p>

<p class="indent">No sound except the rapping of a woodpecker
came from the woods. Peter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
breathed regularly. Presently he opened
his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s in the ribs, by the feel of it&mdash;but
it doesn&#39;t hurt much,&quot; he said. &quot;Felt
like a kick from a horse at first. Remember
not to say anything about Jim Hammond.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They put him to bed at the first farmhouse
they reached. All his clothing on
the right side was stiff with blood. Dick
bandaged the wound; and a doctor arrived
two hours later. The bullet had nipped
in and out, splintering a rib, and lay just
beneath the skin. Peter had bled a good
deal, but not to a dangerous extent.</p>

<p class="indent">Before sunrise the next morning Dick
and Frank Sacobie set out on their return
journey, taking with them a brief telegram
and a letter for Capt. Long. Peter had
dictated the message, but had written the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
letter with great effort, one wavery word
after another.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hammond and John Starkley
reached Pike Settlement late at night. The
storekeeper seemed broken in spirit, but
some color came back to his face when he
saw Peter lying there in the bed at the farmhouse
with as cheerful an air as if he had
only strained his ankle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must see you a few minutes alone before
I leave,&quot; he whispered, stooping over
the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; answered Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">John Starkley was vastly relieved to find
his son doing so well. His bewilderment
that any one in that country should pull a
trigger on Peter almost swamped his indignation.
The more he thought it over the
more bewildered he became.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven&#39;t an enemy in the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
Peter&mdash;except the Germans,&quot; he said. &quot;But
that was no chance shot. If it had been an
accident, the fellow with the rifle would
have come out to lend a hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess that&#39;s so,&quot; replied Peter.
&quot;Maybe it was a German. It means a lot
to the Kaiser to keep me out of this war.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His father smiled. &quot;Joking aside, lad,&quot;
he said, &quot;who do you suppose it was?
What was the bullet? Many a murderer
has been traced before now on a less likely
clue than a bullet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t the bullet on the table there, Mr.
Hammond? The doctor gave it to me, and
I chucked it somewhere&mdash;over there or
somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They looked in vain for the bullet. Later,
when the guests and the household were at
supper, Mr. Hammond excused himself
from table and ran up to Peter&#39;s room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
He closed the door behind him, leaned
over the bed and grasped Peter&#39;s left hand
in both of his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did my best,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I
found him and told him you had been sent
because the officer wanted to give him a
chance. But he had been drinking heavy.
He wasn&#39;t himself, Peter&mdash;he was like a
madman. I begged him to come back with
me, but he wouldn&#39;t hear reason or kindness.
He knocked me down&mdash;me, his own
father&mdash;and got away from that house.
What are you going to do, Peter? You
are a man, Starkley&mdash;a big man&mdash;big
enough to be merciful. What d&#39;you mean
to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Peter. &quot;I came to find
Jim, and I haven&#39;t found him. I got shot
instead by some one I haven&#39;t seen hair,
hide or track of. It&#39;s up to the army to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
find Jim, if they still want him; but as far
as I am concerned he may be back with the
battalion this minute for all I know. I
hope he is. As for the fellow who made a
target of me, well, he didn&#39;t kill me, and I
don&#39;t hold a grudge against him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hammond went home the first thing
in the morning. John Starkley waited until
the doctor called again and dressed the
wound and said he had never seen any one
take a splintered rib and a hole in the side
so well as Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he keeps on like this, you&#39;ll be able
to take him home in ten days or so,&quot; said
the doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">So John Starkley returned to Beaver
Dam, delivered the good news to his family
and heard in return that young Frank
Sacobie had gone to St. John and joined the
26th.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chIII" id="chIII"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>THE VETERANS OF OTHER DAYS</small></h2>

<p class="indent">WHEN Peter was able to travel,
he was taken home to Beaver
Dam, and there a medical
officer, a major in spurs, examined him and
congratulated him on being alive. Peter
was given six months&#39; sick leave; and that,
he knew, killed his chance of crossing the
ocean with his battalion. He protested,
but the officer told him that, whether in
bed in his father&#39;s house or with his platoon,
he was still in the army and would have to
do as he was told. The officer said it
kindly and added that as soon as he was
fit he should return to his battalion, whether
it was in Canada, England or Flanders.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim Hammond vanished. The army
marked him as a deserter, and even his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
battalion forgot him. Confused rumors
circulated round his home village for a
little while and then faded and expired.
As Jim Hammond vanished from the
knowledge and thought of men, so vanished
the mysterious rifleman who had splintered
Peter&#39;s rib.</p>

<p class="indent">Spring brought the great news of the
stand of the First Canadian Division at
Ypres&mdash;the stand of the few against the
many, of the Canadian militia against the
greatest and most ruthless fighting machine
of the whole world. The German army
was big and ready, but it was not great as
we know greatness now. The little Belgians
had already checked it and pierced
the joints of its armor; the French had
beaten it against odds; the little old army
of England, with its monocles and its tea
and its pouter-chested sergeant majors, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
outshot it and outfought it at every meeting;
and now three brigades of Canadian infantry
and a few batteries of Canadian artillery
had stood undaunted before its deluge
of metal and strangling gas and held
it back from the open road to Calais and
Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">Lieut. Pat Hammond wrote home about
the battle. He had been in the edge of it
and had escaped unhurt. Henry Starkley,
of the First Field Company, was there,
too. He received a slight wound. Private
letters and the great stories of the
newspapers thrilled the hearts of thousands
of peaceful, unheroic folk. Volunteers
flowed in from lumber camps and farms.</p>

<p class="indent">In May Dick Starkley made the great
move of his young life. He was now seventeen
years old and sound and strong. He
saw that Peter could not get away with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
battalion&mdash;that, unless something unexpected
happened, the Second Canadian Division
would get away without a Starkley of
Beaver Dam.</p>

<p class="indent">So he did the unexpected thing: he went
away to St. John without a word, introduced
himself to Sgt. Dave Hammer as Peter&#39;s
brother, added a year to his age and became
a member of the 26th Battalion. He found
Frank Sacobie there, already possessed of
all the airs of an old soldier.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick sent a telegram to his father and a
long, affectionate, confused letter to his
mother. His parents understood and forgave
and went to St. John and told him so&mdash;and
Peter sent word that he, too, understood;
and Dick was happy. Then with all
his thought and energy and ambition he set
to work to make himself a good soldier.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter did not grumble again about his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
sick leave. His wound healed; and as the
warm days advanced he grew stronger with
every day. He had been wounded in the
performance of his duty as surely as if a
German had fired the shot across the mud
of No Man&#39;s Land; so he accepted those
extra months in the place and life he loved
with a gratitude that was none the less deep
for being silent.</p>

<p class="indent">In June the Battalion embarked for England,
in strength eleven hundred noncommissioned
officers and men and forty-two
officers. After an uneventful voyage of
eleven days they reached Devenport, in
England, on the twenty-fourth day of the
month. The three other battalions of the
brigade had reached England a month before;
the 26th joined them at the training
camps in Kent and immediately set to work
to learn the science of modern warfare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
They toiled day and night with vigor and
constancy; and before fall the battalion was
declared efficient for service at the front.</p>

<p class="indent">Both Dick Starkley and Frank Sacobie
throve on the hard work. The musketry
tests proved Sacobie to be one of the best
five marksmen in the battalion. Dick was
a good shot, too, but fell far below his friend
at the longer ranges. In drill, bombing
and physical training, Dick showed himself
a more apt pupil than the Malecite. At
trench digging and route marching there
was nothing to choose between them, in
spite of the fact that Sacobie had the advantage
of a few inches in length of leg.
Both were good soldiers, popular with their
comrades and trusted by their officers.
Both were in Dave Hammer&#39;s section and
Mr. Scammell&#39;s platoon.</p>

<p class="indent">One afternoon in August Henry Starkley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
turned up at Westenhanger, on seven
days&#39; leave from France. He looked years
older than when Dick had last seen him and
thinner of face, and on his left breast was
stitched the ribbon of the military cross.
He obtained a pass for Dick and took him
up to London. They put up at a quiet hotel
off the Strand, at which Henry had stopped
on his frequent week-end visits to town from
Salisbury Plain. As they were engaged in
filling in the complicated and exhaustive
registration form the hall porter gave Henry
three letters and told him that a gentleman
had called several times to see him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What name?&quot; asked Henry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That he didn&#39;t tell me, sir,&quot; replied the
porter, &quot;but as it was him wrote the letters
you have in your hand you&#39;ll soon know,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Henry opened one of the envelopes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
turned the inclosure over in quest of the
writer&#39;s signature. There it was&mdash;J. A.
Starkley-Davenport. All three letters were
from the same hand, penned at dates
several weeks apart. They said that before
her marriage the writer&#39;s mother had
been a Miss Mary Starkley, daughter of a
London merchant by the name of Richard
Starkley. Richard Starkley, a colonial by
birth with trade connections with the West
Indies, had come from Beaver Dam in the
province of New Brunswick. The letters
said further that their writer had read in
the casualty lists the name of Lieut. Henry
Starkley of the Canadian Engineers, and
that after diligent inquiry he had learned
that this same officer had registered at the
Canadian High Commissioner&#39;s office in
October, 1914, and given his London address
as the Tudor Hotel. Failing to obtain any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
further information concerning Henry
Starkley, the writer had kept a constant eye
on the Tudor Hotel. He begged Mr.
Henry Starkley to ring up Mayfair 2607,
without loss of time, should any one of
these letters ever come to his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s his hurry, I wonder?&quot; remarked
Henry. &quot;After three generations without a
word I guess he&#39;ll have to wait until to-morrow
morning to hear from the Starkleys
of Beaver Dam.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not let him wait for three more
generations?&quot; suggested Dick. &quot;His grandfather,
that London merchant, soon forgot
about the people back in the woods at
Beaver Dam. Since the second battle of
Ypres, this lad with the hitched-up-double
name wants to be seen round with you,
Henry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If that&#39;s all, he does not want much,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
said Henry. &quot;We&#39;ll take a look at him,
anyway. Don&#39;t forget that the first Starkley
of Beaver Dam was once an English
soldier and that there was a first battle of
Ypres before there was a second.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The brothers, the lieutenant of engineers
and the infantry private, had dinner at a
restaurant where there were shaded candles
and music; then they went to a theater.
Although the war was now only a year old,
London had already grown accustomed to
the &quot;gentleman ranker.&quot; Brothers, cousins
and even sons of officers in the little old
army were now private soldiers and noncommissioned
officers in the big new army.
The uniform was the great thing. Rank
badges denoted differences of degree, not
of kind. So Lieut. Henry Starkley and
Private Dick Starkley, together at their
little luxurious table for two and later elbow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
to elbow at the theater, did not cause
comment. Immediately after breakfast the
next morning Henry rang up the Mayfair
number. A voice of inquiring deference,
a voice that suggested great circumspection
and extreme polish, answered him. Henry
asked for Mr. Starkley-Davenport.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want the captain, sir,&quot; corrected
the voice. &quot;Mr. David was killed at
Ypres in &#39;14. What name, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Starkley,&quot; replied Henry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of Canada, sir? Of Beaver Dam?
Here is the captain, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Another voice sounded in Henry&#39;s ear,
asking whether it was Henry Starkley of the
sappers on the other end of the line.
Henry replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is Jack Davenport speaking&mdash;Starkley-Davenport,&quot;
continued the voice.
&quot;Glad you have my letters at last. Are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
you at the same hotel? Can you wait there
half an hour for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll wait,&quot; said Henry.</p>

<p class="indent">He and Dick awaited the arrival of the
grandson of Richard Starkley with lively
curiosity. That he was a captain, and that
some one connected with him, perhaps a
brother, had been killed at Ypres in 1914,
added considerable interest to him in their
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Size him up before trying any of your
old-soldier airs on him, young fellow,&quot;
warned Henry.</p>

<p class="indent">They sat in the lounge of the hotel and
kept a sharp watch on everyone who entered
by the revolving doors. It was a quiet
place, as hotels go in London, but during the
half hour of their watching more people
than the entire population of Beaver Dam
were presented to their scrutiny. At last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
a pale young fellow in a Panama hat and
a gray-flannel suit entered. Under his left
shoulder was a crutch and in his right hand
a big, rubber-shod stick. His left knee
was bent, and his left foot swung clear of
the ground. His hands were gloved in
gray, and he wore a smoke-blue flower in
his buttonhole. Only his necktie was out
of tone with the rest of his equipment: it
was in stripes of blue and red and yellow.
Behind him, close to his elbow, came a thin,
elderly man who was dressed in black.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lieut. Starkley?&quot; he inquired of the
hall porter.</p>

<p class="indent">At that Henry and Dick both sprang to
their feet and went across to the man in
gray. Before they could introduce themselves
the young stranger edged himself
against his elderly companion, thus making
a prop of him, hooked the crook of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
stick into a side pocket of his coat, and extended
his right hand to Henry. He did
it all so swiftly and smoothly that it almost
escaped notice; and, pitiful as it was, it
almost escaped pity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you lunch with me&mdash;if you have
nothing better to do?&quot; he asked. &quot;You&#39;re
on leave, I know, and it sounds cheek to
ask&mdash;but I want to talk to you about something
rather important.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course&mdash;and here is my young
brother,&quot; said Henry.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain shook hands with Dick and
then stared at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are only a boy,&quot; he said; and then,
seeing the blood mount to Dick&#39;s tanned
cheeks, he continued, &quot;and all the better
for that, perhaps. The nippiest man in
my platoon was only nineteen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course you remember, sir, Mr. David
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
had not attained his twentieth birthday,&quot;
the elderly man in black reminded him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right, Wilson,&quot; said the captain.
&quot;Hit in October, &#39;14. He was my
young brother. There were just the two of
us. Shall we toddle along? I kept my
taxi.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Capt. J. A. Starkley-Davenport occupied
three rooms and a bath in his own house,
which was a big one in a desirable part of
town. The remaining rooms were occupied
by his servants. And such servants!</p>

<p class="indent">The cook was so poor a performer that
whenever the captain had guests for luncheon
or dinner she sent out to a big hotel
near by for the more important dishes&mdash;but
her husband had been killed in Flanders,
and her three sons were still in the field.
Wilson, who had been Jack&#39;s father&#39;s color
sergeant in South Africa, was the valet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
The butler was a one-armed man of forty-five
years who had served as a company
sergeant major in the early days of the war;
in rallying half a dozen survivors of his
company he had got his arm in the way of
a chunk of high-explosive shell and had
decorated his chest with the Distinguished
Conduct Medal. He had only the vaguest
notions what his duties as butler required
of him but occupied his time in arguing the
delicate question of seniority with Wilson
and the coachman and making frequent
reports to the captain.</p>

<p class="indent">The coachman, who had served forty
years in the navy, most of the time as chief
petty officer, claimed seniority of the butler
and Wilson on the grounds of belonging
to the senior service. But the ex-sergeants
argued that the captain&#39;s house was as much
a bit of the army as brigade headquarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
in France, and that the polite thing for any
sailorman to do who found a home there
was to forget all about seniority; and that
for their part they did not believe the British
navy was older than the British army.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Starkley-Davenport introduced
into this household his cousins from Beaver
Dam, without apologies and with only a
few words of explanation. In spite of the
butler&#39;s protests, the valet and the coachman
intruded themselves on the luncheon
party, pretending to wait on table, but in
reality satisfying their curiosity concerning
the military gentlemen from Canada
whose name was the front half of the captain&#39;s
name. They paused frequently in
their light duties round the table and
frankly gave ear to the conversation. Their
glances went from face to face with childish
eagerness, intent on each speaker in turn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
The captain did not mind, for he was accustomed
to their ways and their devouring
interest in him; Henry was puzzled at
first and then amused; and Dick was highly
flattered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There isn&#39;t anyone of our blood in our
regiment now, and that is what I particularly
want to talk to you chaps about,&quot;
said the captain, after a little talk on general
subjects. &quot;My father and young
brother are gone, and the chances are that
I won&#39;t get back. But the interests of the
regiment are still mine&mdash;and I want the
family to continue to have a stake in it.
No use asking you to transfer, Henry, I
can see that; you are a sapper and already
proved in the field, and I know how sappers
feel about their job; but Dick&#39;s an
infantryman. What d&#39;you say to transfer
and promotion, Dick? You can get your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
commission in one of our new battalions as
easy as kiss. It will help you and the old
regiment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But perhaps I shouldn&#39;t make a good
officer,&quot; replied Dick. &quot;I&#39;ve never been
in action, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. I&#39;ll answer for
your quality. You wouldn&#39;t have enlisted
if the right stuff wasn&#39;t in you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I&#39;d like to prove it, first&mdash;although
I&#39;d like to be an officer mighty well. That&#39;s
what I intend to be some day. I think I&#39;ll
stick to the 26th a while. That would be
fairer&mdash;and I&#39;d feel better satisfied, if ever
I won a commission, to have it in my own
outfit. Frank Sacobie would feel sore if I
left him, before we&#39;d ever been in France
together, to be an officer in another outfit.
But there is Peter. He is a corporal already
and a mighty good soldier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
He told all about Peter and the queer
way he was wounded back in Canada and
then all about his friend, Frank Sacobie.
The captain and the three attendants
listened with interest. The captain asked
many questions; and the butler, the valet
and the coachman were on the point of doing
the same many times.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon Wilson, the elderly valet,
took command gently but firmly and led
the captain off to bed. The brothers left
the addresses of themselves and Peter with
the captain and promised to call at every
opportunity and to bring Sacobie to see him
at the first chance.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick and Frank Sacobie continued their
training, and in July Dick got his first
stripe. A few members of the battalion
went to the hospital, and a few were returned
to Canada for one reason or another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
In August a little draft of men fresh from
Canada came to the battalion.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the new men kept inquiring so
persistently for Corp. Peter Starkley that
in the course of time he was passed along
to Dick, who told him about Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m downright sorry to hear that,&quot; said
the new arrival. &quot;I saw him in Mr. Hammond&#39;s
store one day and took a shine to
him, but as you&#39;re his own brother I guess
I&#39;m in the right outfit. Hiram Sill is my
name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They shook hands cordially.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m an American citizen and not so
young as I used to be,&quot; continued Sill, &quot;but
the minute this war started I knew I&#39;d be
into it before long. Soldiering is a business
now, and I am a business man. So
it looked to me as if I were needed&mdash;as if
the energy I was expending in selling boots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
and shoes for Maddock &amp; Co. would count
some if turned against the Kaiser. So I
swore an oath to fight King George&#39;s enemies,
and I guess I&#39;ve made no mistake in
that. King George and Hiram Sill see
eye to eye and tooth to tooth in this war
like two coons at a watermelon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of the fact that Mr. Scammell&#39;s
platoon was already up to strength, Sill
worked his way into it.</p>

<p class="indent">He had a very good reason for wanting
to be in that particular platoon, and there
were men already in it who had no particular
reason for remaining in it instead of
going to some other platoon; so&mdash;as Sill
very justly remarked to Dick, to Sacobie, to
Sergt. Hammer, to Lieut. Scammell and to
Capt. Long&mdash;he did not see why he could
not be where he wanted to be. Friendship
for Frank Sacobie and Dick Starkley and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
admiration for Sergt. Hammer and Lieut.
Scammell were the reasons he gave for
wanting to be in that platoon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He seems a friendly chap,&quot; said the
adjutant to Mr. Scammell. &quot;Will you
take him? If so, you can let the Smith
with the red head go over to Number
Three, where he will be with a whole grist
of lads from his own part of the country.
What d&#39;ye say? He looks smart and willing
to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure I&#39;ll take him,&quot; said Mr. Scammell.
&quot;He says he admires me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Hiram Sill became a member of
Number Two Platoon. He worked with
the energy of a tiger and with the good
nature of a lamb. He talked a great deal,
but always with a view to acquiring or imparting
knowledge. When he found that
his military duties and the cultivation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
friendships did not use up all his time and
energy, he set himself to the task of ascertaining
how many Americans were enrolled
in the First and Second Canadian divisions.
Then indeed he became a busy man; and
still his cry continued to be that soldiering
was a business.</p>

<h2><a name="chIV" id="chIV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>PRIVATE SILL ACTS</small></h2>

<p class="indent">ON the night of September 15, 1915,
the brigade of which the 26th Battalion
was a unit crossed from
Folkstone to Boulogne without accident.
All the ranks were in the highest spirits,
fondly imagining that the dull routine of
training was dead forever and that the practice
of actual warfare was as entertaining
as dangerous.</p>

<p class="indent">The brigade moved up by way of the
fine old city of Saint Omer and the big
Flemish town of Hazebrouck. By the
fourth day after landing in France the
whole brigade was established in the forward
area of operations, along with the
other brigades of the new division. On
the night of the 19th the battalion marched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
up and went into hutments and billets close
behind the Kemmel front. That night,
from the hill above their huts, the men from
New Brunswick beheld for the first time
that fixed, fire-pulsing line beyond which
lay the menace of Germany.</p>

<p class="indent">The battalion went in under cover of
darkness, and by midnight had taken over
from the former defenders the headquarters
of companies, the dugouts in the support
trenches and the sentry posts in the fire
trench. There were Dick Starkley and his
comrades holding back the Huns from the
throat of civilization. It was an amazing
and inspiring position to be in for the first
time. In front of them, just beneath and
behind the soaring and falling star shells
and Very lights, crouched the most ruthless
and powerful armies of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">To the right and left, every now and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
then, machine guns broke forth in swift,
rapping fire. When the fire was from the
positions opposite, the bullets snapped in the
air like the crackings of a whip. The
white stars went up and down. Great guns
thumped occasionally; now and then a high
shell whined overhead; now and then the
burst of an exploding shell sounded before
or behind. It was a quiet night; but to the
new battalion it was full of thrills. The
sentries never took their eyes from the mysterious
region beyond their wire. Every
blob of blackness beyond their defenses set
their pulses racing and sent their hands to
their weapons.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick Starkley and Frank Sacobie stood
shoulder to shoulder on the fire step for
hours, staring with all their eyes and listening
with all their ears. Hiram Sill sat at
their feet and talked about how he felt on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
this very particular occasion. His friends
paid no attention to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is the proudest moment of my life,&quot;
he said. &quot;We are historic figures, boys&mdash;and
that&#39;s a thing I never hoped to be. In
my humble way, I stand for more than
George Washington did. This is a bigger
war than George ever dreamed of, and I
have a bigger and better reason for fighting
the Huns than Gen. Washington ever
had for fighting the fool Britishers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see that?&quot; asked Dick of Sacobie.
&quot;Over in the edge of their wire.
There! Look quick now! Is it a man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Looks like a man, but it&#39;s been there
right along and ain&#39;t moved yet,&quot; said
Frank. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s a stump.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Lieut. Scammell came along.
He got up on the fire step and, directed by
Dick, trained his glass on the black thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
in the edge of the enemy&#39;s wire. A German
star shell gave him light.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a German&mdash;a dead one,&quot; he said.
&quot;I&#39;ve been told about him. There was a
bit of a scrap over there three nights ago,
and that is one of the scrappers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram forgot about Gen. Washington
and mounted the fire step to have a look.
He borrowed the officer&#39;s glass for the purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do his friends intend to leave him out
there much longer, sir?&quot; he asked. &quot;If
they do, it&#39;s a sure sign of weakness.
They&#39;re scart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are scart, right enough&mdash;but I
bet they wouldn&#39;t be if they knew this bit
of trench was being held now by a green
battalion,&quot; replied Mr. Scammell. &quot;They&#39;d
be over for identifications if they knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let them come!&quot; exclaimed Private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Sill. &quot;I bet a dollar they wouldn&#39;t stay to
breakfast&mdash;except a few who wouldn&#39;t want
any.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a rifle cracked to the
right of them, evidently from their own
trench and not more than one hundred yards
away. It was followed close by a spatter
of shots, then the smashing bursts of grenades,
more musketry and the <i>rat-tat-tat</i> of
several machine guns. Bullets snapped in
the air. Lights trailed up from both lines.
Dull thumps sounded far away, and then
came the whining songs of high-flying
shells. Flashes of fire astonished the eye,
and crashing reports stunned the ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re at us!&quot; exclaimed the lieutenant.
&quot;Open fire on the parapet opposite, unless
you see a better target, and don&#39;t leave
your posts. Keep low. Better use the
loopholes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
He left the fire step and ran along the
duck boards toward the heart of the row.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick and Frank Sacobie and Hiram
Sill, firing rapidly through the loopholes,
added what they could to the disturbance.
Now and again a bullet rang against the
steel plate of a loophole. One or another
of them took frequent observations through
a periscope, for at that time the Canadian
troops were not yet supplied with shrapnel
helmets. Dave Hammer, breathless with
excitement, joined them for a few seconds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They tried to jump us,&mdash;must have
learned we&#39;re a green relief,&mdash;but we&#39;ve
chewed them up for fair!&quot; he gasped.
&quot;Must have been near a hundred of &#39;em&mdash;but
not one got through our wire. Keep
yer heads down for a while, boys; they&#39;re
traversing our top with emmagees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last the enemy&#39;s artillery fire slackened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
and died. Ours drubbed away cheerily
for another fifteen minutes, then ceased
as quick and clean as the snap of a finger.
The rifle fire and machine-gun fire dwindled
and ceased. Even the up-spurting of
the white and watchful stars diminished by
half; but now and again one of them from
the hostile lines, curving far forward in its
downward flight, illuminated a dozen or
more motionless black shapes in and in front
of our rusty wire. Except for those motionless
figures No Man&#39;s Land was again deserted.
The big rats ran there undisturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">Sacobie looked over the parapet; Hiram
Sill and Dick sat on the fire step at the
Malecite&#39;s feet. They felt as tired as if
they had been wrestling with strong men
for half an hour. Dave Hammer came
along the trench and halted before them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those Huns or Fritzes or whatever you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
call them are crazy,&quot; he said. &quot;Did you
ever hear of such a fool thing as that?
They&#39;ve left a dozen dead out in front, besides
what they carried home along with
their wounded&mdash;and all they did to us was
wound three of our fellows with that first
bomb they threw, and two more with
machine-gun fire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Their officers must be boneheads, for
sure,&quot; said Hiram. &quot;War&#39;s a business,&mdash;and
a mighty swift one,&mdash;and you can&#39;t succeed
in business without knowing something
about psychology. Yes, gentlemen,
psychology, queer as it may sound.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sounds mighty queer to me!&quot; muttered
Sacobie, glancing down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must study men,&quot; continued Private
Sill, not at all abashed, &quot;their souls and
hearts and minds&mdash;if you want to make a
success at anything except bee farming.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
Now, take this fool raid of the Huns. They
were smart enough to find out that a bunch
of greenhorns took over this trench to-night.
So they thought they&#39;d surprise us. Now,
if they&#39;d known anything about psychology,
they&#39;d have known that just because we
were new and green we&#39;d all be on our
toes to-night, with our eyes sticking out a
yard and our ears buttoned right back.
Sure! Every man of us was on sentry duty
to-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you&#39;ve got the right idea, Old
Psychology,&quot; said the sergeant.</p>

<p class="indent">The 26th spent five days in the line on
that tour. With the exception of one day
and night of rain they had fine weather.
They mended their wire and did a fair
amount of business in No Man&#39;s Land.
The enemy attempted no further raids; his
last effort had evidently given him more information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
concerning the quality of the
new battalion than he could digest in
a week. At any rate he kept very
quiet.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the tour the battalion went
back a little way to huts on the bushy flanks
of Scherpenberg, where they &quot;rested&quot; by
performing squad, platoon and company
drill and innumerable fatigues. The time
remaining at their disposal was devoted to
football and base-ball and investigations of
villages and farmsteads in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Their second tour in was more lively and
less comfortable than the first. Under the
drench of rain and the gnawing of dank
and chilly mists their trenches and all the
surrounding landscape were changed from
dry earth to mud. Everything in the front
line, including their persons, became caked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
with mud. The duck boards became a
chain of slippery traps; and in low trenches
they floated like rafts. The parapets slid
in and required constant attention; and what
the water left undone in the way of destruction
the guns across the way tried to finish.</p>

<p class="indent">It was hard on the spirit of new troops;
they were toughened to severe work and
rough living, but not to the deadening mud
of a front-line trench in low ground. So
their officers planned excitement for them,
to keep the fire of interest alive in their
hearts. That excitement was obtained in
several ways, but always by a move of some
sort against the enemy or his defenses.
Patrol work was the most popular form of
relief from muddy inaction. Lieut. Scammell
quickly developed a skill in that and
an appetite for it that soon drew the colonel&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
attention to himself and his followers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">By the end of September, even the medical
officers of New Brunswick had to admit
that Corp. Peter Starkley was fully recovered
from his wound. As for Peter himself,
he affirmed that he had not felt anything
of it for the past two months. He had
worked at the haying and the harvesting on
Beaver Dam and his own place without
so much as a twinge of pain.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter returned to his military duties
eagerly, but inspired only by his sense of
duty. His heart was more than ever in his
own countryside; but despite his natural
modesty he knew that he was useful to his
king and country as a noncommissioned
officer, and with that knowledge he fortified
his heart. He tried to tell Vivia Hammond
something of what he felt. His words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
were stumbling and inadequate, but she
understood him. And at the last he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Vivia, don&#39;t forget me, for I shall be
thinking of you always&mdash;more than of anyone
or anything in the world.&quot; And then,
not trusting his voice for more, he kissed
her hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">Vivia wept and made no attempt to hide
her tears or the reason for them.</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly before Peter&#39;s return to the army
he had received a letter from Capt. Starkley-Davenport,
telling of the reunion of
the cousins in London and virtually offering
him a commission in the writer&#39;s old
regiment. Peter had also heard something
of the plan from Dick a few days before.
He answered the captain&#39;s letter
promptly and frankly, to the effect that he
had no military ambition beyond that of
doing his duty to the full extent of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
power against Germany, and that a commission
in an English regiment was an
honor he could accept only if it should
come to him unavoidably, in the day&#39;s
work.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter reached England in the third week
of October and with three hundred companions
fresh from Canada was attached to
a reserve battalion on St. Martin&#39;s Plain
for duty and instruction. Peter was given
the acting rank of sergeant. Early in
December he crossed to France and reached
his battalion without accident. He found
that the 26th had experienced its full share
of the fortunes and misfortunes of war.
Scores of familiar faces were gone. His
old platoon had suffered many changes
since he had left it in St. John a year ago.
Its commander, a Lieut. Smith, was an entire
stranger to him, and he had known the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
platoon sergeant as a private. Mr. Scammell
was now scout officer and expecting
his third star at any moment. Dave Hammer,
still a sergeant, and Dick, Sacobie and
Hiram Sill also were scouts. Dick, was a
corporal now and had never been touched
by shot, shell or sickness. Sacobie had been
slightly wounded and had been away at a
field ambulance for a week.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter rejoined his old platoon and, as it
was largely composed at this time of new
troops, was permitted to retain his acting
rank of sergeant. He performed his duties
so satisfactorily that he was confirmed
in his rank after his first tour in
the trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">On the third night of Peter&#39;s second tour
in the front line, Dave Hammer, Dick and
Frank Sacobie took him out to show him
about. All carried bombs, and Sergt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Hammer had a pistol as well. They were
hoping to surprise a party of Germans at
work mending their wire.</p>

<p class="indent">Hammer slipped over the parapet. Peter
followed him. Dick and Sacobie went
over together, quick as the wink of an eye.
Their faces and hands were black. With
Dave Hammer in the lead, Peter at the
very soles of his spiked boots and Dick and
Sacobie elbow to elbow behind Peter, they
crawled out through their own wire by the
way of an intricate channel. When a star
shell went up in front, near enough to light
that particular area, they lay motionless.
They went forward during the brief periods
of darkness and half light.</p>

<p class="indent">At last they got near enough to the German
wire to see it plainly, and the leader
changed his course to the left. When they
lay perfectly still they could hear many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
faint, vague sounds in every direction: far,
dull thuds before and behind them, spatters
of rifle fire far off to the right and left, the
bang of a Very pistol somewhere behind
a parapet and now and then the crash of
a bursting shell.</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later Dave twisted about
and laid a hand on Peter&#39;s shoulder. He
gave it a gentle pull. Peter crawled up
abreast of him. Dave put his lips to Peter&#39;s
ear and whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There they are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A twisty movement of his right foot had
already signaled the same information to
the veterans in the rear. Peter stared at
the blotches of darkness that Dave had indicated.
They did not move often or
quickly and kept close to the ground.
Sometimes, when a light was up, they became
motionless and instantly melted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
view, merging into the shadows of the night
and the tangled wire. Now and then Peter
heard some faint sound of their labor, as
they worked at the wire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only five of them,&quot; whispered the scout
sergeant. &quot;They are scared blue. Bet
their skunks of officers had to kick them
out of the trench. Let&#39;s sheer off a few
yards and give &#39;em something to be scared
about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Dick and Frank squirmed up
beside them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some more straight ahead of us,&quot;
breathed the Indian. &quot;Three or four.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hammer used his glass and saw that Sacobie&#39;s
eyes had not fooled him. He
touched each of his companions to assure
himself of their attention, then twisted sharp
to the left, back toward their own line, and
crawled away. They followed. After he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
had covered about ten yards, Dave turned
end for end in his muddy trail, and the
others came up to him and turned beside
him. They saw that the wiring party and
the patrol had joined.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spread a bit,&quot; whispered Dave. &quot;I&#39;ll
chuck one at &#39;em, and when it busts you
fellows let fly and then beat it back for the
hole in our wire. Take cover if the emmagees
get busy. I&#39;ll be right behind
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They moved a few paces to the right and
left. Peter&#39;s lips felt dry, and he wanted
to sneeze. He took a plump, cold, heavy
little grenade in his muddy right hand. A
few breathless, slow seconds passed and
then <i>smash!</i> went Dave&#39;s bomb over against
the Hun wire. Then Peter stood up and
threw&mdash;and three bombs exploded like one.</p>

<p class="indent">Turning, Peter slithered along on all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
fours after Dick and Sacobie. The startled
Huns lighted up their front as if for a
national fête; but Peter chanced it and kept
on going. A shrapnel shell exploded overhead
with a terrific sound, and the fat bullets
spattered in the mud all round him.
He came to another and larger crater and
was about to skirt it when a familiar voice
exclaimed:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in here, you idiot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was Dick and Frank Sacobie
standing hip-deep in the mud and water at
the bottom of the hole. Peter joined them
with a few bushels of mud. A whiz-bang
whizzed and banged red near-by, and
the three ducked and knocked their
heads together. The water was bitterly
cold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you think you were on your way
to the barns to milk?&quot; asked Dick. &quot;Don&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
you know the machine guns are combing
the ground?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll remember,&quot; said Peter. &quot;New
work to me, and I guess I was a bit flustered.
I wonder where Dave Hammer has
got himself to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some hole or other, sure,&quot; said Sacobie.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry &#39;bout Dave. He put three
bombs into them. I counted the busts.
Fritz will quiet down in a few minutes, I
guess, and let us out of here&mdash;if our fellows
don&#39;t get gay and start all the artillery
shootin&#39; off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Our fellows did not get gay, our artillery
refrained from shooting off, and soon the
enemy ceased his frenzied musketry and
machine gunning and bombing of his own
wire and the harmless mud beyond. So
Peter and Dick and Sacobie left their wet
retreat and crawled for home. They found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
Sergt. Hammer waiting for them at the hole
in the wire. He had already given the
word to the sentry; and so they made the
passage of the wire and popped into the
trench. Hammer reported to Mr. Scammell,
who was all ready to go out with another
patrol; and then the four went back
to their dugout in the support trench, devoured
a mess of potatoes and onions, drank
a few mugs of tea and retired to their blankets,
mud and putties and all.</p>

<p class="indent">That was the night of the 3d of December.
In the battalion&#39;s summary of
intelligence to the brigade it read like
this:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Night of 23d-24th, our patrols active.
Small patrol of four, under 106254 Sgt. D.
Hammer, encountered ten of the enemy in
front of the German wire. Bombs were
exchanged and six of the enemy were killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
or wounded. Our patrol returned. 2.30
<span class="smcap">a. m.</span> Lieut. Scammell placed tube in hostile
wire which exploded successfully. No
casualties.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next day passed quietly, with a pale
glimmer of sunshine now and then, and between
glimmers a flurry of moist snow.
The Germans shouted friendly messages
across No Man&#39;s Land and suggested a complete
cessation of hostilities for the day and
the morrow. The Canadians replied that
the next Fritz who cut any &quot;love-your-enemy&quot;
capers on the parapet would get what
he deserved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peace on earth!&quot; exclaimed the colonel
of the 26th. &quot;They are the people to ask
for it, the murderers! No, this is a war
with a reason&mdash;and we shoot on Christmas
Eve just as quick as on any other
day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
The day passed quietly. Soon after sunset
Mr. Scammell sent two of his scouts
out to watch the gap in the German wire
that he had blown with his explosive tube.
They returned at ten o&#39;clock and reported
that the enemy had made no attempt to
mend the gap. The night was misty and
the enemy&#39;s illumination a little above normal.</p>

<p class="indent">At eleven o&#39;clock Lieut. Scammell went
out himself, accompanied by Lieut. Harvey
and nine men. They reached the gap in
the enemy wire without being discovered,
and there they separated. Mr. Harvey and
two others moved along the front of the
wire to the left, and a sergeant and one man
went to the right. Mr. Scammell and his
five men passed through the wire and extended
a few yards to the left, close under
the hostile parapet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
The officer stood up, close against the
wet sandbags. Dave Hammer, Dick, Peter,
Hiram Sill and Sacobie followed his
example.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, all together, they tossed six bombs
into the trench. The shattering bangs of
six more blended with the bangs of the
first volley. From right and left along the
trench sounded other explosions.</p>

<p class="indent">Obeying their officer&#39;s instructions,
Scammell&#39;s men made the return journey
through the wire and struck out for home
at top speed, trusting to the mist to hide
their movements from the foe.</p>

<p class="indent">Scammell rid himself of three more
bombs and then followed his party. The
white mist swallowed them. The bombers
ran, stumbled and ran again, eager to reach
the shelter of their own parapet before the
shaken enemy should recover and begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
sweeping the ground with his machine
guns.</p>

<p class="indent">Sacobie and Dick were the first to get into
the trench. Then came Sergt. Hammer
and Lieut. Scammell, followed close by
Lieut. Harvey and his party. By that
time the German machine guns were going
full blast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are Sergt. Starkley and Private Sill
here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t see either of &#39;em, sir,&quot; Sergt.
Hammer said in reply to Mr. Scammell&#39;s
question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps they got here before any of us
and beat it for their dugout,&quot; said Mr.
Scammell. &quot;Dick, you go along the trench
and have a look for them. If they aren&#39;t
in, come back and report to me. Wait
right here for me, mind you&mdash;on <i>this</i> side
of the parapet. Get that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
Then the officer spoke a few hurried
words to Sergt. Hammer, a few to the sentry,
and went over the sandbags like a snake.
Hammer went out of the trench at the same
moment; and Frank Sacobie took one
glance at the sentry and followed Hammer
like a shadow. The mist lay close and
cold and almost as wet as rain over that
puddled waste.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Scammell found Peter and Hiram
about ten yards in front of the gap in our
wire; the private was unhurt and the sergeant
unconscious. Sill had his tall friend
on his back and was crawling laboriously
homeward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whiz-bang,&quot; he informed Mr. Scammell.
&quot;It got Pete bad, in the leg. I heard
him grunt and soon found him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They regained the trench, picking up
Hammer on the way, and sent Peter out on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
a stretcher. Sacobie came in at their heels;
and no one knew that he had gone out to
the rescue.</p>

<p class="indent">That happened on Christmas morning.
Before night the doctors cut off what little
had been left below the knee of Peter&#39;s right
leg.</p>

<h2><a name="chV" id="chV"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>PETER&#39;S ROOM IS AGAIN OCCUPIED</small></h2>

<p class="indent">LIFE was very dull round Beaver
Dam after Peter had gone away.
John and Constance Starkley and
Flora and Emma felt that every room of
the old house was so full of memories of
the three boys that they could not think of
anything else. John Starkley worked early
and late, but a sense of numbness was always
at his heart. There were times when
he glowed with pride and even when he
flamed with anger, but he was always conscious
of the weight on his heart. His
grief was partly for his wife&#39;s grief.</p>

<p class="indent">He awoke suddenly very early one morning
and heard his wife sobbing quietly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
That had happened several times before,
and sometimes she had been asleep and at
other times awake. Now she was asleep,
lonely for her boys even in her dreams.
He thought of waking her; and then he reflected
that, if awake, she would hide her
tears, which now perhaps were giving her
some comfort in her dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">But he could not find his own sleep again.
He lighted a candle, put on a few clothes
and went downstairs to the sitting room.
There were books everywhere, of all sorts,
in that comfortable and shabby room. The
brown wooden clock on the shelf above the
old Franklin stove ticked drearily. It
marked ten minutes past two. Mr. Starkley
dipped into a volume of Charles Lever
and wondered why he had ever laughed at
its impossible anecdotes and pasteboard love
scenes. He tried a report of the New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Brunswick Agricultural Society and found
that equally dry. A flyleaf of Treasure Island
held his attention, for on it was penned
in a round hand, &quot;Flora with Dick&#39;s love,
Christmas, 1914.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was only a boy then,&quot; murmured
the father. &quot;Less than a year ago he was
only a boy, and now he is a man, knowing
hate and horror and fatigue&mdash;a man fighting
for his life. They are all boys! Henry
and Peter&mdash;Peter with his grand farm and
fast mares, and his eyes like Connie&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Starkley got out of his chair, trembling
as if with cold. He walked round
the room, clasping his hands before him.
Then he took the candle from the table and
held it up to the shelf above the stove.
There stood photographs of his boys, in
uniform. He held the little flame close to
each photograph in turn.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
&quot;Three sons,&quot; he said. &quot;Three good sons&mdash;and
not one here now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A cautious rat-tat on the glass of one of
the windows brought him out of his reveries
with a start. He went to the window
without a moment&#39;s hesitation, held the
candle high and saw a face looking in at
him that he did not recognize for a moment.
It was a frightened and shamed
face. The eyes met his for a fraction
of a second and then shifted their
glance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;James Hammond!&quot; exclaimed Mr.
Starkley. &quot;Of all people!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He set the candle on the table and pushed
up the lower sash of the window, letting in
a gust of cold wind that extinguished the
light behind him. He could see the bulk
of his untimely visitor against the vague
starlight.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;Come in, James,&quot; he said. &quot;By the
window or the door, as you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Mr. Starkley,&quot; said Hammond
in guarded tones. &quot;The window
will do. No strangers about, I suppose?
Just the family?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only my wife and daughters,&quot; replied
the farmer, and turned to relight the candle.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim Hammond got quickly across the
sill, pulled the sash down, and after it the
green-linen shade. He stood near the wall,
twirling his hat in his hand and shuffling
his feet. When Mr. Starkley turned to
him, he swallowed hard, glanced up and
then as swiftly down again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Queer time to make a call,&quot; said Hammond
at last. &quot;Near three o&#39;clock, Mr.
Starkley. I was glad to see your light at
the window. I was scared to tap on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
window, at first, for fear you&#39;d send me
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send you away?&quot; queried the farmer.
&quot;Why did you fear that, Jim? You, or any
other friend, are welcome at this house at
any hour of the day or night. But I must
admit that your visit has taken me by surprise.
I thought you were far away from
this peaceful and lonely country, my boy&mdash;far
away in Flanders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The blood flushed over Jim&#39;s face, and
he stared at the farmer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You thought I was in Flanders,&quot; he said.
&quot;In Flanders&mdash;me! So you don&#39;t know
about me, Mr. Starkley? Peter didn&#39;t
tell you about me? That&mdash;that&#39;s impossible.
Don&#39;t you know&mdash;and every one
else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking
about,&quot; replied Mr. Starkley, as he pushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
Jim into an armchair. &quot;I can see that you
are tired, however, and in distress of some
sort. Why are you here, Jim&mdash;and why
are you not in uniform? Tell me&mdash;and if
I can help you in any way you may be sure
that I will. Rest here and I&#39;ll get you
something to eat. I did not notice at first
how bad you look, Jim.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind the food!&quot; muttered young
Hammond. &quot;I&#39;m not hungry, sir&mdash;not to
matter, that is. But I&#39;m dog-tired. I&#39;ve
been hiding about in the woods and in people&#39;s
barns for a long time&mdash;and walking
miles and miles. I&mdash;you say you don&#39;t
know&mdash;I am a deserter&mdash;and worse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t go to France with your regiment?
You deserted?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t go anywhere with it. Why
didn&#39;t Peter tell you? I came home on
pass&mdash;and gave them the slip. I&mdash;Peter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
was sent here to fetch me back. And he
didn&#39;t tell you! And you thought I was in
France! I came here because I was
ashamed to go home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He suddenly leaned forward in his chair,
with his elbows on his knees, and covered
his face with his hands. His shoulders
shook. John Starkley continued to gaze at
him in silence for a minute or two, far too
amazed and upset and bewildered to know
what to say or do. He felt a great pity for
the young man, whom he had always known
as a prosperous and self-confident person.
To see him thus&mdash;shabby, weary, ashamed
and reduced to tears&mdash;was a most pitiful
thing. A deserter! A coward! But even
so, who was he to judge? Might not his
sons have been like this, except for the
mercy of God? Even now any one of his
boys, or all three of them, might be in great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
need of help and kindness. He went over
and laid a hand gently on his visitor&#39;s
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you have done,
exactly, or anything at all of your reason
for doing it, but you are the son of a friend
of mine and have been a comrade of one of
my sons,&quot; he said. &quot;Look upon me as a
friend, Jim. You say you are a deserter.
Well, I heard you. It is bad&mdash;but here is
my hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jim Hammond raised his head and looked
at Mr. Starkley with a tear-stained face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean that?&quot; he asked; and at
the other&#39;s nod he grasped the extended
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Starkley asked him no more questions
then, but brought cold ham from the
pantry and cider from the cellar and ate
and drank with him. The visitor&#39;s way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
with the food and drink told its own story
and sharpened the farmer&#39;s pity. They
went upstairs on tiptoe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Peter&#39;s room,&quot; said Mr. Starkley.
&quot;Sleep sound and as long as you
please&mdash;till dinner time, if you like. And
don&#39;t worry, Jim.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The farmer returned to his own room
and found his wife sleeping quietly. He
wakened her and told her of young Hammond&#39;s
visit and all that he knew of his
story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad you took him in,&quot; she said.
&quot;We must help him for our boys&#39; sakes,
even if he is a deserter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Mr. Starkley, &quot;we must
help him through his shame and trouble&mdash;and
then he may right the other matter of
his own free will. We&#39;ll give him a chance,
anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
It was dinner time when Jim Hammond
awoke from his sleep of physical and nervous
exhaustion. He was puzzled to know
where he was at first, but the memory of
the night&#39;s adventure came to him, bringing
both shame and relief. He had no
watch to tell him the time, and there was
no clock in the room. He had brought
nothing with him&mdash;not a watch, or a dollar,
or a shirt&mdash;nothing except his guilt and
his shame. He flinched at the thought
of meeting Mrs. Starkley and the
girls.</p>

<p class="indent">A knock sounded on the door, and John
Starkley looked in and wished him good
morning. &quot;If you get up now, Jim, you&#39;ll
be in time for dinner,&quot; he said. &quot;Here is
hot water and a shaving kit&mdash;and a few
duds of Henry&#39;s and Peter&#39;s you can use if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
you care to. Set your mind at rest about
the family, Jim. I have told my wife all
that I know myself, and she feels as I do.
As for the girls&mdash;well, I will let them know
as much as is necessary. We mean
to help you to get on your feet again,
Jim.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The deserter shaved with care, dressed
in his own seedy garments and went slowly
downstairs. He entered the kitchen. Mrs.
Starkley and Flora were there, busy about
the midday dinner. They looked up at him
and smiled as he appeared in the doorway,
but their eyes and Flora&#39;s quick change of
color told him of the quality of their pity.
They would feel the same, he knew, for any
broken and drunken tramp in the ditch.
But he was a more despicable thing than
a drunken tramp. He was a deserter, a
coward. They knew that of him, for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
saw it in their eyes that tried to be so frank
and kind; and that was not the worst of
him. He could not advance from the
threshold or meet their glances again.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Starkley went to the young man
quickly and, taking his hand in hers, drew
him into the room. Flora came forward
and gave him her hand and said she was
glad to see him; and then Emma came in
from the dining room and said, &quot;Hello, Mr.
Hammond! I hope you can stay here a
long time; we are very lonely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His heart was so shaken by those words
that his tongue was suddenly loosened.
He looked desperately, imploringly round,
and his face went red as fire and then white
as paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll stay&mdash;if you&#39;ll let me&mdash;until I pick
up my nerve again,&quot; he said quickly and
unsteadily. &quot;Keep me hidden here from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
Stanley and my folks. I&#39;ll work like a nigger.
I am a deserter, as you all know&mdash;and
I know that Peter didn&#39;t tell you so. I&#39;d
do anything for him, after that. I&#39;m a
runaway soldier, but it wasn&#39;t because I
was afraid to fight. I&#39;ll show you as soon
as I&#39;m fit&mdash;I&#39;ll go and fight. It was my
beastly temper and drink that did for me.
I&#39;ve been near crazy since. But I&#39;ll show
you my gratitude some day&mdash;if you give me
a chance now to work round to feeling something
like a man again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flora and Emma were tongue-tied by
the stress of their emotions. They could
only gaze at their guest with tear-dimmed
eyes. But Mrs. Starkley went close to him
and put a hand on each of his drooped
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, my dear boy,&quot; she said.
&quot;You are only a boy, Jim, a year or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
younger than Henry, I think. Trust us to
help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During dinner they talked about the
country, the war, the weather and the stock&mdash;about
almost everything but Jim Hammond&#39;s
affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want me to do this afternoon?&quot;
asked Jim when the meal was over.
&quot;I don&#39;t know much about farm work, but
I can use an axe and can handle horses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was ploughing this morning; and this
may be our last day before the frost sets in
hard,&quot; said Mr. Starkley. &quot;What about
hitching Peter&#39;s mares to a second plow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suit me fine,&quot; said Jim.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a still, bright October afternoon,
with a glow in the sunshine, a smell of fern
and leaf in the air and a veil of blue mist on
the farther hills. Frosts had nipped the
surface of things lightly a score of times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
but had not yet struck deep. Jim Hammond,
in a pair of Peter&#39;s long-legged boots,
guided a long plough behind Peter&#39;s black
and sorrel mares. The mares pulled steadily,
and the bright plough cut smoothly
through the sod of the old meadow. Over
against the fir woods on the far side of the
meadow John Starkley went back and forth
behind his grays.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim rested frequently at the end of a furrow,
for he was not in the pink of condition.
He noticed, for the first time in his
life, the faint perfume of the turned loam
and torn grass roots. He liked it. His
furrows, a little uneven at first, became
straighter and more even until they were
soon almost perfect.</p>

<p class="indent">As the red sun was sinking toward the
western forests, Emma appeared, climbing
over the rail fence from a grove of young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
red maples. She carried something under
one arm. She waved a hand to her father
but came straight to Jim. He stopped the
mares midway the furrow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I made these gingernuts myself,&quot; said
Emma, holding out an uncovered tin box
to him. &quot;See, they are still hot. Have
some.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He accepted two and found them very
good. The girl looked over his work admiringly
and told him she had never seen
straighter furrows except a few of Peter&#39;s
ploughing. Then she warned him that in
half an hour she would blow a horn for
him to stop and went across to her father
with what was left of the gingernuts.
Hammond went on unwinding the old sod
into straight furrows until the horn blew
from the house.</p>

<p class="indent">After supper he played cribbage with Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
Starkley; and that night he slept soundly
and without dreaming. He awoke early
enough to do his share of the feeding and
milking before breakfast. The ploughs
worked again that day, but the next night
brought a frost that held tight.</p>

<p class="indent">The days went by peacefully for Jim
Hammond. He never went on the highway
or away from Beaver Dam and Peter&#39;s
place. Sometimes, when people came to
the house, he sat by himself in his room
upstairs. He did his share of all the barn
work, twice a week helped Mrs. Starkley
and the girls with the churning and cut
cordwood and fence rails every day. He
never talked much, but at times his manner
was almost cheerful. And so the days
passed and October ran into November.
Snow came and letters from France and
England. The family treated him like one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
of themselves, with never a question to embarrass
him or a word to hurt him. He
heard news of his family occasionally, but
never tried to see them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They think I am somewhere in the
States, hiding&mdash;or that&#39;s what father
thinks,&quot; he said to Flora. &quot;Some day I&#39;ll
write to mother&mdash;from France.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">December came and Christmas. Jim
kept house that day while the others drove
to Stanley and attended the Christmas service
in the church on the top of the long
hill. A week later a man in a coonskin
coat drove up to the kitchen door. Jim
recognized him through the window as the
postmaster of Stanley and retired up the
back stairs. John Starkley, who had
just come in from the barns, opened the
door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A cablegram for you, Mr. Starkley,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
said the postmaster. &quot;It was wired
through from Fredericton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held out the thin envelope. Mr.
Starkley stared at it, but did not move.
His eyes narrowed, and his face looked
suddenly old.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No call to be afraid of it,&quot; said the
postmaster, who was also the telegraph
operator. &quot;I received it and know what&#39;s
in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Starkley took it then and tore it
open.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peter wounded. Doing fine. Dick
Starkley&quot; is what he read. He sighed with
relief and called to Mrs. Starkley and the
girls. Then he invited the man from Stanley
in to dinner, saying he would see to the
horse in a minute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t expect much better news than
that from men in France,&quot; John Starkley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
said to his wife. &quot;Wounded and doing
fine&mdash;why, that&#39;s better than no news, by a
long shot. He will be safe out of the line
now for weeks, perhaps for months. Perhaps
he will even get to England. He is
safe at this very minute, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He excused himself, went upstairs and
told Jim Hammond the news.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is twice for Peter already,&quot; he
said, &quot;once right at home and once in
Flanders. If this one isn&#39;t any worse than
the first, we have nothing to worry about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope it is just bad enough to give him
a good long rest,&quot; said Jim in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">The postmaster stayed to dinner, and
Emma smuggled roast beef and pudding up
to Jim in his bedroom. No sooner had
that visitor gone than another drove up.
This other was Vivia Hammond; and once
more Jim retired to his room. Vivia had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
heard of the cablegram, but nothing of its
import. Her face was white with anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; she cried. &quot;The cable&mdash;what
is it about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peter is right as rain&mdash;wounded but doing
fine,&quot; said John.</p>

<p class="indent">Vivia cried and then laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love Peter, and I don&#39;t care who knows
it!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I hope he has lost
a leg, so they&#39;ll have to send him home.
That sounds dreadful&mdash;but I love him so&mdash;and
what does a leg matter?&quot; She turned
to Mrs. Starkley. &quot;Did he ever tell you
he loved me?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t have to tell us,&quot; answered
Mrs. Starkley, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does! He does!&quot; exclaimed the
girl, and then began to cry again; and Jim,
imprisoned upstairs, wished she would go

<h2><a name="chVI" id="chVI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>DAVE HAMMER GETS HIS COMMISSION</small></h2>

<p class="indent">BY the middle of January, 1916, Peter
was in London again, now minus
one leg but otherwise in the pink of
condition. Davenport, with his crutch and
stick and shadowing valet, visited him daily
in hospital. He and Peter wrote letters to
Beaver Dam&mdash;and Peter wrote a dozen to
Stanley.</p>

<p class="indent">Capt. Starkley-Davenport had power.
Warbroken and propped between his crutch
and stick, still he was powerful. A spirit
big enough to animate three strong men
glowed in his weak body, and he went after
the medical officers, nursing sisters and
V. A. D.&#39;s of that hospital like a lieutenant
general looking for trouble. He saw that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
Peter received every attention, and then that
every other man in the hospital received the
same&mdash;and yet he was as polite as your
maiden aunt. Several medical officers, including
a colonel, jumped on him&mdash;figuratively
speaking&mdash;only to jump back again
as if they had landed on spikes.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as he regarded Peter as fit to be
moved he took him to his own house. There
the queer servants waited on Peter day and
night in order of seniority. They addressed
him as &quot;Sergt. Peter, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Over in Flanders things had bumped and
smashed along much as usual since Christmas
morning. Mr. Scammell had read his
promotion in orders and the London Gazette,
had put up his third star and had
gone to brigade as staff captain, Intelligence;
and David Hammer, with the acting
rank of sergeant major, carried on in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
command of the battalion scouts. Hiram
Sill had been awarded the Distinguished
Conduct Medal for his work on Christmas
morning and the two chevrons of a corporal
for his work in general. A proud man
was Corp. Sill, with that ribbon on his
chest.</p>

<p class="indent">The changes and chances of war had
also touched Dick Starkley and Frank Sacobie.
Lieut. Smith had persuaded Dick to
leave the scouts and become his platoon sergeant;
Sacobie was made an acting sergeant&mdash;and
the night of that very day, while
he was displaying his new chevrons in No
Man&#39;s Land, he received a wound in the
neck that put him out of the line for two
weeks.</p>

<p class="indent">Henry Starkley&mdash;a captain now&mdash;managed
to visit the battalion about twice a
month. It was in the fire trench that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
found Dick one mild and sunny morning
of the last week of February. The brothers
grinned affectionately and shook hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peter has sailed for home, wooden leg
and all,&quot; said Henry. &quot;I got a letter yesterday
from Jack Davenport. Except for the
sneaking Hun submarines, Peter is fairly
safe now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope he makes the farm,&quot; said Dick.
&quot;He was homesick for it every minute and
working out crop rotations on the backs of
letters every night, in the line and out&mdash;except
when he was fighting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was something about you in Jack&#39;s
letter. He says that offer still stands, and
he seems as anxious as ever about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick sat down on the fire step, thrust out
his muddy feet on the duck boards and
gazed at them. He scratched himself
meditatively in several places.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
&quot;I&#39;d like fine to be an officer,&quot; he said
at last. &quot;Almost any one would. But I
don&#39;t want to leave this bunch just now.
Jack&#39;s crowd will want officers in six months
just as much as now&mdash;maybe more; and if
I&#39;m lucky&mdash;still in fighting shape six months
from now&mdash;I&#39;ll be better able to handle
the job.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll write that to Jack,&quot; said Henry.
&quot;He will understand&mdash;and your platoon
commander will be pleased. He and the
adjutant talked to me to-day as if something
were coming to you&mdash;a D. C. M., I think.
What happened to your first adjutant, Capt.
Long, by the way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Long&#39;s gone west,&quot; replied Dick briefly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Shell get
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sniper. He took one chance too
many.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
&quot;I heard at the brigade on my way in that
your friend, Dave Hammer, has his commission.
I wonder if they have told him
yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good! Let&#39;s go along and tell him.
He is sleeping to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They found Dave in his little dugout,
with the mud of last night&#39;s expedition
still caked on his person from heel to head.
His blankets were cast aside, and he lay
flat on his back and snored. His snores had
evidently driven the proprietors of the
other bunks out of that confined place, for
he was alone. His muddy hands clasped
and unclasped. He ceased his snoring suddenly
and gabbled something very quickly
and thickly in which only the word &quot;wire&quot;
was recognizable. Then he jerked up one
leg almost to his chin and shot it straight
again with terrific force.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
&quot;He is fighting in his dreams, just the
way my old dog Snap used to,&quot; said Dick.
&quot;We may as well wake him up, for he isn&#39;t
resting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go to it&mdash;and welcome,&quot; said Henry.
&quot;It&#39;s an infantry job.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick stooped and cried, &quot;Hello, Dave!&quot;
but the sleeper only twitched an arm.
&quot;Wake up!&quot; roared Dick. &quot;Wake up and
go to sleep right!&quot; The sleeper closed his
mouth for a second but did not open his
eyes. He groaned, muttered something
about too much light and began to snore
again. Dick put a hand on his shoulder&mdash;and
in the same breath of time he was
gripped at wrist and throat with fingers
like iron. Grasping the hand at his throat,
Dick pulled a couple of fingers clear.
Then the sleeper closed his mouth again and
opened his eyes wide.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, Dick!&quot; he said. &quot;Sorry.
Must have been dreaming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sat up and shook hands with Henry.
When he heard of his promotion he blushed
and got out of his bunk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a bit of cheering news,&quot; he said
&quot;I&#39;ll have a wash on the strength of that,
and something to eat. Wish we were out,
and I&#39;d give a little party. Wonder if I
can raise a set of stars to wear to-night,
just for luck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Henry went away half an hour later, and
Dick returned to the fire trench. Capt.
Keen, the adjutant, came looking for Hammer,
found him still at his toilet and
congratulated him heartily on his promotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along and feed with me, if you
have had enough sleep,&quot; said the adjutant.
&quot;The colonel wants to see you. He had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
talk with you yesterday, didn&#39;t he&mdash;about
to-night&#39;s job?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir; and it will be a fine job, if the
weather is just right. Looks now as if it
might be too clear, but we&#39;ll know by sundown.
I was dreaming about it a while
ago. We were in, and I had a big sentry
by the neck when Dick Starkley woke me
up. I had grabbed Dick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The colonel is right,&quot; said Capt. Keen.
&quot;You&#39;re working too hard, Hammer, and
you&#39;re beginning to show it; your eyes look
like the mischief. This fighting in your
sleep is a bad sign.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The whole army could do with a rest,
for that matter,&quot; replied Hammer, &quot;but
who would go on with the work? What
I am worrying about now is rank
badges. I&#39;d like to doll up a bit for to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
They went back to the sandbagged cellar
under the broken farmhouse that served
as headquarters for whatever battalion held
that part of the line. On their way they
had borrowed an old jacket with two stars
on each sleeve from Lieut. Smith; and in
that garment Dave Hammer appeared at
the midday meal. The colonel, the medical
officer, the padre and the quartermaster
were there. They congratulated Dave on
his promotion, and the colonel placed him
at his right hand at the table on an upended
biscuit box.</p>

<p class="indent">The fare consisted of roast beef and
boiled potatoes, a serviceable apple pie and
coffee. The conversation was of a general
character until after the attack on the pie&mdash;an
attack that was driven to complete success
only by the padre, who prided himself
on the muscular development of his jaws.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
The commanding officer, somewhat daunted
in spirit by the pastry, looked closely at the
lieutenant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need a rest, Hammer,&quot; he said.
&quot;Keen, didn&#39;t I tell you yesterday that
Hammer must take a rest? Doc, just slant
an eye at this young officer and give me
your opinion. Doesn&#39;t he look like all-get-out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Looks like get-out-of-the-front-line to
me, sir,&quot; said the medical officer. &quot;A
couple of weeks back would set him on
his feet. You say the word, sir, and I&#39;ll
send him back this very day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the show!&quot; exclaimed Hammer.
&quot;I must go out to-night, sir!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hammer is the only officer with his
party, sir,&quot; said Capt. Keen to the colonel.
&quot;As you know, sir, we held the organization
down this time to only one officer with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
each of our four parties&mdash;because officers
are not very plentiful with us just
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the trouble!&quot; exclaimed the colonel.
&quot;They hem and haw and chew the
rag over our recommendations for commissions
and keep sending us green officers
from England who don&#39;t know the fine
points of the game. So here we are forced
to let Hammer go out to-night, when he
should be in his blankets. But back he
goes to-morrow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dave had intended to sleep that afternoon,
but the excitement caused by the news
of his promotion made it impossible. He
who had never missed a minute&#39;s slumber
through fear of death was set fluttering at
heart and nerves by the two worsted &quot;pips&quot;
on each sleeve of his borrowed jacket.
The coat was borrowed&mdash;but the right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
wear the stars was his, his very own, earned
in Flanders. He toured the trenches&mdash;fire,
communication and support&mdash;feeling that
his stars were as big as pie plates.</p>

<p class="indent">Sentries, whose bayonet-tipped rifles
leaned against the parapet, saluted and
then grasped his hand. Subalterns and
captains hailed him as a brother; and so
did sergeants, with a &quot;sir&quot; or two thrown
in. As Dave passed on his embarrassed
but triumphant way down the trench his
heart pounded as no peril of war had ever
set it pounding. No emperor had ever
known greater ache and uplift of glory than
this grand conflagration in the heart and
brain of Lieut. David Hammer, Canadian
Infantry.</p>

<p class="indent">He visited his scouts; and they seemed as
pleased at his &quot;pips&quot; as if each one of them
had got leave to London. Even Sergt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
Frank Sacobie&#39;s dark and calm visage
showed flickers of emotion. Corp. Hiram
Sill, D. C. M., who visioned everything in
a large and glowing style, saw in his mind&#39;s
eye the King in Buckingham Palace agreeing
with some mighty general, all red and
gold and ribbons, that this heroic and deserving
young man should certainly be
granted a commission for the fine work he
was doing with the distinguished scouts of
that very fine regiment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t a doubt that was the way of
it,&quot; said Old Psychology. &quot;People with
jobs like that are trained from infancy to
grasp details; and I bet King George has
the name of everyone of us on the tip of his
tongue. You can bet your hat he isn&#39;t one
to give away Distinguished Conduct Medals
without knowing what he is about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram joined in the laughter that followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
his inspiring statements; not that he
thought he had said anything to laugh at,
but merely to be sociable.</p>

<p class="indent">That &quot;show&quot; was to be a big one&mdash;a brigade
affair with artillery coöperation. The
battalion on the right was to send out two
parties, one to bomb the opposite trench
and the other to capture and demolish a
hostile sap head&mdash;and together to raise Old
Ned in general and so hold as much of the
enemy&#39;s attention as possible from the main
event. The battalion on the left was to
put on an exhibition of rifle, machine-gun
and trench-mortar fire that would assuredly
keep the garrison opposite occupied with
its own affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the artillery, it had already worked
through two thirds of its elaborate programme.
Four nights ago it had put on a
shoot at two points in the hostile wire and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
front line, three hundred yards apart, short
but hot. Then it had lifted to the support
and reserve trenches. Three nights ago it
had done much the same things, but not at
the same hours, and on a wider frontage.
The enemy, sure of being raided, had
turned on his lights and his machine guns
on both occasions&mdash;on nothing. He could
do nothing then toward repairing his wire,
for after our guns had churned up his entanglements
our machine guns played upon
the scene and kept him behind his parapet.
The batteries had been quiet two nights ago,
and Fritz, expecting a raid in force, had
lost his nerve entirely. Our eighteen
pounders had lashed him at noon the next
day, and again at sunset and again at eleven
o&#39;clock; and so he had sat up all night
again with his nerves.</p>

<p class="indent">At four o&#39;clock in the afternoon of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
day of Dave Hammer&#39;s promotion the batteries
went at it again, smashing wire and
parapets with field guns and shooting up
registered targets farther back with heavier
metal. When hostile batteries retaliated,
we did counter-battery work with such
energy and skill that we soon had the
last word in the argument. The deeds
of the gunners put the infantry in high
spirits.</p>

<p class="indent">The afternoon grew misty; shortly after
five o&#39;clock there was a shower. At half
past seven scouts went out from the 26th
and the battalion on the right and, returning,
reported that the wire was nicely ripped
and chewed. At eight the battalion on the
left put on a formidable trench-mortar
shoot, which quite upset the nerve-torn
enemy. Then all was at rest on that particular
piece of the western front&mdash;except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
for the German illumination&mdash;until half
past twelve.</p>

<p class="indent">Half past twelve was Zero Hour. A
misty rain was seeping down from a slate-gray
sky. Six lieutenants in the fire trench
of two battalions took their eyes from the
dials of their wrist watches, said &quot;time&quot; to
their sergeants and went over, with their
men at their heels and elbows. The two
larger parties from our battalion were to
get into the opposite trench side by side,
there separate one to the left and one to the
right, do what they could in seven minutes
or until recalled, then get out and run for
home with their casualties&mdash;if any. They
were to pass their prisoners out as they collared
them. The smaller parties were
made up of riflemen, stretcher bearers and
escorts for the prisoners. The raiding
parties were commanded by Mr. Hammer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
with Sergt. Sacobie second in command,
and Mr. Smith, with Sergt. Richard Starkley
second in command. Corp. Hiram Sill
was in Hammer&#39;s crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Scammell from brigade, the
colonel and the adjutant stood in the trench
at the point of exit. Suddenly they heard
the dry, smashing reports of grenades
through the chatter of machine-gun fire on
the left. The bombs went fast and furious,
punctuated by the crack of rifles and bursts
of pistol fire. S. O. S. rockets went up from
the German positions; and, as if in answer
to those signals, our batteries laid a heavy
barrage on and just in rear of the enemy&#39;s
support trenches. The colonel flashed a
light on his wrist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have been in four minutes,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a muddy figure with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
blackened face and hands and a slung rifle
on his back scrambled into the trench,
turned and pulled something over the
parapet that sprawled at the colonel&#39;s
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s one of them, sir; and there&#39;s more
coming,&quot; said the man of mud. &quot;Ah!
Here&#39;s another. Boost him over, you fellers.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 501px;">
<a name="i167" id="i167"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i167.jpg" width="501" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;&#39;HERE&#39;S ONE OF THEM, SIR; AND THERE&#39;S MORE
COMING,&#39; SAID THE MAN OF MUD.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Into the trench tumbled another Fritz,
and then a third, and then a Canadian, and
then two more prisoners and the third
Canadian.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Five,&quot; said the last of the escort. &quot;Us
three started for home with eight, but something
hit the rest of &#39;em&mdash;T-M bomb, I
reckon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure it was,&quot; said the Canadian who had
arrived first. &quot;Don&#39;t I know? I got a
chunk of it in my leg.&quot; He stooped and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
fumbled at the calf of his right leg. The
adjutant turned a light on him, and the man
extended his hand, dripping with blood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You beat it for the M. O., my lad,&quot;
said the colonel.</p>

<p class="indent">Five more prisoners came in under a
guard of two; and then six more of the
raiders arrived, two of whom were carrying
Lieut. Smith. The lieutenant&#39;s head
was bandaged roughly, and the dressing
was already soaked with blood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We did them in, sir,&quot; he said thickly to
the colonel. &quot;Caught them in bunches&mdash;and
bombed three dugouts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was carried away, still muttering of
the fight. By that time the majority of the
other parties were in. Several of the men
were wounded&mdash;and they had brought their
dead with them, three in number. The
Germans had turned their trench mortars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
on their own front line from their support
trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re not all in yet,&quot; said Capt. Keen.
&quot;Hammer isn&#39;t in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Dick Starkley slid into the
trench.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you, Dick? Did you see Mr.
Hammer? Or Frank Sacobie? Or Bruce
McDonald?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have McDonald&mdash;but some one&#39;s got
to help me lift him over,&quot; said Dick breathlessly.
&quot;Heavy as a horse&mdash;and hit pretty
bad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two men immediately slipped over the
top and hoisted big McDonald into the
trench. Hiram Sill put a hand on Dick&#39;s
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dave Hammer and Sacobie,&quot; he whispered,
&quot;are still out. Hadn&#39;t we better&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right,&quot; said Dick. &quot;Come on out.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
He turned to Capt. Scammell. &quot;Please
don&#39;t let the guns shorten for a minute or
two, sir; Sill and I have to go out again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without waiting for an answer they
whipped over the sandbags. Hiram was
back in two minutes. He turned on the
fire step and received something that Dick
and Frank Sacobie lifted over to him. It
was Dave Hammer, unconscious and breathing
hoarsely, with his eyes shut, his borrowed
tunic drenched with mud and blood
and one of his bestarred sleeves shot away.
Capt. Scammell swayed against the colonel
and, for a second, put his hand to his
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steady, lad, steady,&quot; said the colonel in
a queer, cracked voice. &quot;Keen, tell the
guns to drop on their front line with all
they&#39;ve got&mdash;and then some.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To the whining and screeching of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
shells driving low overhead and the tumultuous
chorus of their exploding, passed the
undismayed soul of Lieut. David Hammer
of the Canadian Infantry.</p>

<p class="indent">Heedless of the coming and going of the
shells and the quaking of the parapet, Sacobie
sat on the fire step with his hands between
his knees and stared fixedly at nothing;
but Hiram Sill and young Dick Starkley
wept without thought of concealment,
and their tears washed white furrows down
their blackened faces.</p>

<h2><a name="chVII" id="chVII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>PETER WRITES A LETTER</small></h2>

<p class="indent">IN March, 1916, Sergt. Peter Starkley
got back to his own country, bigger
in the chest and an inch taller than
when he had gone away. He walked a little
stiffly on his right foot, it is true&mdash;but what
did that matter? His letters to the people
at home had, by intention, given them only
a vague idea of the possible date of his arrival.
They knew that he was coming, that
he was well, and that his new leg was such
a masterpiece of construction that he had
danced on it in London on two occasions.
Otherwise he was unannounced.</p>

<p class="indent">He went to the town of Stanley first
and left his baggage in the freight shed
at the siding. With his haversack on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
shoulder and a stout stick in his right hand,
he set out along the white and slippery
road. Before he got to the bridge a two-horse
sled overtook him, and the driver, an
elderly man whom he did not know, invited
him to climb on. Peter accepted the
invitation with all the agility at his command.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You step a mite lame on your right leg,&quot;
said the driver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s so,&quot; replied Peter, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Been soldierin&#39;, hey? See any fight-in&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve been in Flanders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That so? I&#39;ve got a boy in the war.
Smart boy, too. They give him a job right
in England. He wears spurs to his boots,
he does; and it ain&#39;t everyone kin wear them
spurs, he writes me. This here war ain&#39;t
all in Flanders. We had some shootin&#39;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
round here about a year back out Pike&#39;s Settlement
way. A young feller in soldier uniform
was drivin&#39; along, and some one shot
at him from the woods. That&#39;s what <i>he</i>
said, but my boy&mdash;that was afore he went
to the war&mdash;says like enough he shot himself
so&#39;s to git out of goin&#39;. He&#39;s a smart
lad&mdash;that&#39;s why they give him a job in England.
Army Service Corps, he is&mdash;so I
reckon maybe he&#39;s right about that feller
shootin&#39; himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s his name?&quot; asked Peter quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Starkley. Peter Starkley from Beaver
Dam.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m asking the name of that smart son
of yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gus Todder&#39;s his name&mdash;Gus Todder,
junior. Maybe you know him,&quot; was the
reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but I&#39;ve got his number,&quot; said Peter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
&quot;You tell him so in the next letter you write
him. Tell him that Sergt. Peter Starkley
of the 26th Canadian Infantry Battalion will
be glad to see him when he comes home;
tell him not to cut himself on those spurs
of his in the meantime; and you&#39;d better
advise him to warn <i>his father</i> not to shoot
his mouth off in future to military men
about things he is ignorant of. Here&#39;s
where I get off. Thanks for the lift.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter left the sled, but turned at the
other&#39;s voice and stood looking back at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t get the hang of all that you was
sayin&#39;,&quot; said Todder. He was plainly disconcerted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind; your son will catch the
drift of it,&quot; replied Peter. &quot;I am too happy
about getting home to be fussy about little
things, but don&#39;t chat quite so freely with
every returned infantryman you see about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
your son&#39;s smartness. You call it smartness&mdash;but
the fellows up where I left my
right leg have another name for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Opening the white gate, he went up the
deep and narrow path between snow banks
to the white house. At the top of the short
flight of steps that led to the winter porch
that inclosed the front door, he looked over
his shoulder and saw Todder still staring
at him. Peter grinned and waved his
hand, then opened the door of the porch.</p>

<p class="indent">As he closed the door behind him, the
house door opened wide before him.
Vivia stood on the threshold. She stared
at him with her eyes very round and her
lips parted, but she did not move or speak.
She held her slim hands clasped before her&mdash;clasped
so tight that the knuckles were
colorless. Her small face, which had been
as pale as her clasped hands at the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
glimpse, turned suddenly as red as a rose;
and her eyes, which had been very bright
even to their wonderful depths, were
dimmed suddenly with a shimmer of tears.
And for a long time&mdash;for ten full seconds,
it may have been&mdash;Peter also stood motionless
and stared. The heavy stick slipped
from his fingers and fell with a clatter on
the floor of the porch. He stepped forward
then and enfolded her in his khaki-clad
arms, safe and sure against the big
brass buttons of his greatcoat; and just then
the door of the porch opened, and Mr.
Todder said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ain&#39;t got the hang of yer remarks yet,
young feller.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Chase yourself away home,&quot; replied
Peter, without turning his head; and there
was something in the tone of his voice that
caused Mr. Todder to withdraw his head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
from the porch and to retire, muttering, to
his sled. Vivia had not paid the slightest
heed to the interruption. She drew Peter
into the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was afraid,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I didn&#39;t
know how much they had hurt you, Peter&mdash;but
I wasn&#39;t afraid of that. I should love
you just as much if they had crippled you,&mdash;I
am so selfish in my love, Peter,&mdash;but I
was afraid, at first, that I might see a
change in your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There couldn&#39;t be a change in my eyes
when I look at you, unless I were blind,&quot;
said Peter. &quot;Even if I were blind, I guess
I could see you. But I am the same as I
was, inside and out&mdash;all except a bit of
a patent leg.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Mrs. Hammond made her discreet
appearance, expressed her joy and surprise
at the sight of Peter and ventured a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
motherly kiss. Mr. Hammond came in
from the store half an hour later and welcomed
Peter cordially. The man had lost
weight, and his face was grim. He got
Peter to himself for a few minutes just before
supper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jim is still on the other side the border
somewhere, I guess,&quot; he said, &quot;though I
haven&#39;t heard from him for months. I&#39;ve
kept the shooting business quiet, Peter&mdash;and
even about his deserting; but I had to tell
his mother and Vivia that he wasn&#39;t any
good as a soldier and had gone away. I
made up some kind of story about it.
Other people think he&#39;s in France, I guess&mdash;even
your folks at Beaver Dam. But
what do you hear of Pat? He isn&#39;t much
of a hand at writing letters, but was well
when he wrote last to his mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t see him over there, but Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
ran across him and said that he is doing
fine work. He&#39;s got his third pip and is
attached to headquarters of one of the brigades
of the First Division as a learner.
He has been wounded once, I believe, but
very slightly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I used to think that Pat wasn&#39;t
much good&mdash;too easy-going and loose-footed,&quot;
said Mr. Hammond bitterly. &quot;My
idea of a man was a storekeeper. Well,
I think of him now, and I stick out my
chest&mdash;and then I remember Jim, and my
chest caves in again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were interrupted then by Vivia; so
nothing more was said about the deserter.
After supper Peter had to prove to the
family that he could dance on his new leg.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll hitch the grays to the pung,&quot; said
Mr. Hammond when about eight o&#39;clock
Peter got ready to go. &quot;It&#39;s a fine night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
and the roads are a marvel. I&#39;ll drive you
home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am going too,&quot; said Vivia.</p>

<p class="indent">Dry maple sticks burned on the hearth
of the big Franklin stove in the sitting room
of Beaver Dam. Flora sat at the big table
writing a letter to Dick; John Starkley and
Jim Hammond played checkers; and Mrs.
Starkley nodded in a chair by the fire.
Emma had gone to bed. John Starkley had
his hand raised and hovering for a master
move when a jangle of bells burst suddenly
upon their ears. Flora darted to a window,
and the farmer hastened to the front
door; but by the time Flora had drawn back
the curtains and her father had opened the
door Jim Hammond was upstairs and in his
room.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim did not light the candle that stood
on the window sill at the head of his bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
He closed the door behind him. The
blind was up; starshine from the world of
white and purple and silver without sifted
faintly into the little room. He stood for
a minute in the middle of the floor, listening
to the broken and muffled sounds of
talk and laughter from the lower hall. He
heard a trill of Vivia&#39;s laughter. What
had brought Vivia out again, he wondered.
News of Peter, beyond a doubt; and
good news, to judge by the sounds. He
seated himself cautiously on the edge of
the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">Now he heard his father&#39;s voice. Yes&mdash;and
John Starkley was laughing. There
was another man&#39;s voice, but he could hear
only a low note of it now and then in the
confused, happy babble of sound. A door
shut&mdash;and then he could not hear anything.
He wondered who the third man was and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
decided that he probably was some one
from the village who had just arrived home
and who had brought messages from Peter.
Perhaps, he thought, Peter was even then
on his way from England.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim sat there with the faint shine of the
stars falling soft on the rag carpet at his
feet and thought what wonderful people
the Starkleys were. They had taken him
in and treated him like one of the family&mdash;and
like a white man. Now that Peter
was coming home and would be able to
help with the work, he would go away and
show John Starkley that he had found his
courage and his manhood. He had made
his plans in a general way weeks before.
He would go to another province and enlist
in the artillery or in the infantry under
an assumed name; if he &quot;made good,&quot; or
got killed, John Starkley would tell all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
good he could of him to his family in Stanley.
Already he felt lonely, a dreary chill
of homesickness, at the thought of leaving
Beaver Dam.</p>

<p class="indent">A door opened and closed downstairs,
but Jim Hammond was too busy with his
thoughts and high resolves to hear the faint
sounds. He even did not hear the feet on
the carpeted stairs&mdash;and a hand was on the
latch of the door before he knew that some
one was about to enter the room. He sat
rigid and stared at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened and some one entered
who bulked large and tall in the pale half
gloom of the room. The visitor halted and
turned his face toward the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; he asked; and Jim could
see the shoulders lower and advance a
little and the whole figure become tense as
if for attack.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s me, Peter!&quot; whispered Jim sharply
&quot;Shut the door quick!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You! You, Jim Hammond!&quot; said
Peter in a voice of amazement and anger.
&quot;What the mischief are you doing here?&quot;
Without turning his face from the bed he
shut the door behind him with his heel.
&quot;Light the candle and pull down the shade.
Let me see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jim got to his feet and reached for the
shade, but Peter spoke before he touched it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! The candle first!&quot; exclaimed
Peter, with an edge to his voice. &quot;I don&#39;t
trust you in the dark any more than I trust
you in the woods.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hammond struck a match and lit the
candle, then drew down the shade and
turned with his back to the window. His
face was pale. &quot;I didn&#39;t figure on your
getting home so soon,&quot; he said in an unsteady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
voice. &quot;I didn&#39;t intend to be
here. I thought I&#39;d be gone before you
came.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing here, anyway?&quot;
demanded Peter. &quot;What&#39;s the game?
Sitting in my room, on my bed, quite at
home, by thunder! And your father thinks
you are in the States. Does my father
know you are here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jim smiled faintly. &quot;Yes, he knows&mdash;and
all your folks know. I&#39;ve been here
since about the middle of October, working,
and sleeping in this room every night. My
people don&#39;t know where I am&mdash;but when
I get to France you can tell them. Your
father doesn&#39;t know that it was I who fired
that shot&mdash;and when I found you hadn&#39;t
told him that, or even that I was a deserter,
I felt it was up to me to do my best for
you while you were away. So I&#39;ve worked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
hard and been happy here; and I&#39;ll be sorry
to go away&mdash;but I must go now that you&#39;re
home again. Don&#39;t tell my people I&#39;m
here, Peter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have been living here ever since
the middle of October, working here, and
your own father and mother don&#39;t know
where you are?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your people are the only ones who
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter eyed him in silence for a minute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you shoot me, Jim?&quot; he asked
more gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do I know?&quot; exclaimed Hammond.
&quot;I was drinking; I was just about
mad with drink. I liked you well enough,
Peter,&mdash;I didn&#39;t want to kill you,&mdash;but the
devil was in me. It was drink made me
act so bad in St. John; it was drink made
me desert; it was drink that came near making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
a murderer of me. That&#39;s the truth,
Peter&mdash;and now I wish you&#39;d go downstairs,
for I don&#39;t want my father or Vivia
to find me here&mdash;or to know anything about
me till I&#39;m in France.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I find you here when I come
back?&quot; asked Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll come downstairs as soon as they
go,&quot; said Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter was about to leave the room when
he suddenly remembered the errand that
had brought him away from the company
downstairs. It was a photograph of himself
taken at the age of five years. Vivia
had heard of it and asked for it; and before
either of his parents or Flora had been
able to think of a way of stopping him he
had started upstairs for it. Now he found
it on the top of a shelf of old books and
wiped off the dust on his sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
&quot;Vivia wants it,&quot; he said, smiling self-consciously.</p>

<p class="indent">He found Flora waiting at the head of
the stairs for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all right; I&#39;ve had a talk with him,&quot;
he whispered, and when he reached the sitting
room he met the anxious glances of
his parents with a smile and nod that set
their immediate anxieties at rest.</p>

<p class="indent">It was past midnight when Vivia and her
father drove away. Then Jim came downstairs,
and Peter shook hands with him in
the most natural way in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When we met in my bedroom we were
both too astonished to shake hands,&quot; explained
Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must sleep in Dick&#39;s room now,
Peter,&quot; said Mrs. Starkley.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only for one night,&quot; said Jim, trying
to smile but making a poor job of it. &quot;I&#39;ll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
be off to-morrow, now that Peter is home
again&mdash;just as I planned all along, you
know. I&mdash;it isn&#39;t the going back to the
army I mind; it is&mdash;leaving you people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled more desperately than ever.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Starkley and Flora did not dare
trust their voices to reply. John Starkley
laid a hand on Jim&#39;s shoulder and said,
&quot;Go when it suits you, Jim, and come back
when it suits you&mdash;and we shall miss you
when you are away, remember that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The three men sat up for another hour,
talking of Peter&#39;s experiences and Jim&#39;s
plans. They went upstairs at last, but even
then neither Peter nor Jim could sleep, for
the one was restless with happiness and the
other with the excitement of impending
change. Peter would see Vivia on the
morrow, and Jim would meet strange faces.
Peter had returned to the security that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
had fought and shed his blood for and to
the life and people he loved; Jim&#39;s fighting
was all before him, and behind him a disgrace
to be outlived.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while Peter got up and went to
Jim&#39;s room in his pyjamas; he sat on the
edge of Jim&#39;s bed, and they talked of the
fighting over in France.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about my reënlistment,&quot;
said Jim, &quot;and I guess I&#39;ll take a
chance on my own name. It&#39;s my
name I want to make good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sounds risky&mdash;but I don&#39;t believe it is
as risky as it sounds,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not if I go far enough away to enlist&mdash;to
Halifax or Toronto. There must be
lots of Hammonds in the army. I&#39;ll take
the risk, anyway. It isn&#39;t likely I&#39;ll run
across any of the old crowd. None of our
old officers would be hard on me, I guess, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
they found me fighting and doing my duty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Capt. Long is dead. A great many of
the old crowd are dead, and others have
been promoted out of the regiment. Remember
Dave Hammer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. If I could ever be as good a soldier
as Dave Hammer I think I&#39;d forget&mdash;except
sometimes in the middle of the night,
maybe&mdash;what a mean, worthless fellow I
have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what, Jim,&quot; said Peter suddenly,
&quot;I&#39;ll write a letter for you to carry;
and if any one spots you over there and is
nasty about it, you go to any officer you
know in the old battalion and tell the truth
and show my letter. I guess that will clear
your name, Jim, if you do your duty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean to put <i>everything</i> in the
letter, do you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only what is known officially&mdash;that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
went home from your regiment here in
Canada on pass, started acting the fool and
deserted. That is the charge against you,
Jim&mdash;desertion. But it is the mildest sort
of desertion, and reënlistment just about
offsets it. The same thing done in France
in the face of the enemy is punished&mdash;you
know how.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know how it is punished,&quot; said
Hammond. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t worry about
that if you knew as much about how I feel
now as I do myself. Of course I&#39;ve got to
prove it before you&#39;ll believe it, Peter, but
I&#39;m not afraid to fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Peter had gone back to his room,
he sat down to write the letter that Jim
Hammond was to carry in his pocket. It
was a long letter, and Peter was a slow
writer. He spared no pains in making
every point of his argument perfectly clear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
He staked the military reputation of the
whole Starkley family on James Hammond&#39;s
future behavior as a soldier. He
sealed it with red wax and his great-grandfather&#39;s
seal and addressed the envelope to
&quot;Any Officer of the 26th Can. Infty. Bn. or
of any Unit of the Can. Army Corps of the
B. E. F.&quot; When finally he had the letter
done, it was morning.</p>

<h2><a name="chVIII" id="chVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>THE 26TH &quot;MOPS UP&quot;</small></h2>

<p class="indent">AFTER Jim Hammond went away
from Beaver Dam he wrote to
Mrs. Starkley from Toronto, saying
that he had enlisted in a new infantry
battalion and that all was well with him.
That was the last news from him, or of
him, to be received at Beaver Dam for
many months.</p>

<p class="indent">The war held and crushed and sweated
on the western front. Every day found the
Canadians in the grinding and perilous toil
of it. In April, 1916, the Second Canadian
Division held the ground about St.
Eloi against terrific onslaughts. Then and
there were fought those desperate actions
known as the Battles of the Craters. Hiram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
Sill, D. C. M., now a sergeant, received
a wound that put him out of action
for nearly two months. Dick Starkley was
buried twice, once beneath the lip of one
of the craters as it returned to earth after
a jump into the air, and again in his dugout.
No bones were broken, but he had
to rest for three days.</p>

<p class="indent">Other Canadian divisions moved into the
Ypres salient in April&mdash;back to their first
field of glory of the year before. That
salient of terrible fame, advanced round
the battered city of Ypres like a blunt spearhead
driven into the enemy&#39;s positions, will
live for centuries after its trenches are
leveled. British soldiers have fallen in
their tens of thousands in and beyond and
on the flanks of that city of destruction.
From three sides the German guns flailed
it through four desperate years. Masses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
of German infantry surged up and broke
against its torn edges, German gas drenched
it, liquid fire scorched it, and mines blasted
it. Now and again the edge of that salient
was bent inward a little for a day or a
week; but in those four years no German
set foot in that city of heroic ruins except
as a prisoner.</p>

<p class="indent">The 26th Battalion celebrated Dominion
Day&mdash;July 1st&mdash;by raiding a convenient
point of the German front line. The assault
was made by a party of twenty-five
&quot;other ranks&quot; commanded by two junior
officers. It was supported by the fire of
our heavy field guns and heavy and medium
trench mortars.</p>

<p class="indent">Sergts. Frank Sacobie and Hiram Sill
were of the party, but Dick Starkley was
not. Dick could not be spared for it from
his duties with his platoon, for he was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
acting command during the enforced absence
of Lieut. Smith, who was suffering
at a base hospital from a combination of
gas and fever. The men from New Brunswick
were observed by the garrison of the
threatened trench while they were still on
the wrong side of the inner line of hostile
wire, and a heavy but wild fire was opened
on them with rifles and machine guns. But
the raiders did not pause. They passed
through the last entanglement, entered the
trench, killed a number of the enemy and
collected considerable material for identification.
Their casualties were few, and no
wound was of a serious nature. Hiram
Sill was dizzy and bleeding freely, but
cheerful. One small fragment of a bomb
had cut open his right cheek, and another
had nicked his left shoulder. Sacobie carried
him home on his back.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
It was a little affair, remarkable only as
a new way of celebrating Dominion Day,
and differed only in minor details from hundreds
of other little bursts of aggressive
activity on that front.</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the month a Distinguished Service
Order, two Military Crosses, four Distinguished
Conduct Medals and five Military
Medals were awarded to the battalion
in recognition of its work about St. Eloi.
Dick Starkley and Frank Sacobie each drew
a D. C. M. A few days after that Lieut.
Smith returned from Blighty and took back
the command of his platoon from Dick;
and at the same time he informed Dick
that he was earmarked for a commission.</p>

<p class="indent">The Canadians began their march from
the Ypres salient to the Somme on September
1, 1916. They marched cheerfully,
glad of a change and hoping for the best.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
The weather was fine, and the towns and
villages through which they passed seemed
to them pleasant places full of friendly
people. They were going to fight on a
new front; and, as became soldiers, it was
their firm belief that any change would be
for the better.</p>

<p class="indent">On the 8th of September, while on the
march, Dick Starkley was gazetted a lieutenant
of Canadian Infantry. Mr. Smith
found his third star in the same gazette,
and Dick took the platoon. Henry visited
the battalion a few days later and presented
to the new lieutenant an old uniform that
would do very well until the London tailors
were given a chance. Dick was a proud
soldier that day; and an opportunity of
showing his new dignity to the enemy soon
occurred. That opportunity was the famous
battle of Courcelette.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
From one o&#39;clock of the afternoon of
September 14 until four o&#39;clock the next
morning our heavy guns and howitzers belabored
with high explosive shells the fortified
sugar refinery and its strong trenches
and the village of Courcelette beyond.
Then for an hour the big guns were silent.
The battalions of the Fourth and Sixth Brigades
waited in their jumping-off trenches
before Pozières. The Fifth Brigade, of
which the 26th Battalion was a unit, rested
in reserve.</p>

<p class="indent">Dawn broke with a clear sky and promise
of sunshine and a frosty tingle in the air.
At six o&#39;clock the eighteen-pounder guns
of nine brigades of artillery, smashing into
sudden activity, laid a dense barrage on
the nearest rim of the German positions.
Four minutes later the barrage lifted and
jumped forward one hundred yards, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
the infantry climbed out of their trenches
and followed it into the first German
trench. The fight was on in earnest, and in
shell holes, in corners of trenches and
against improvised barricades many great
feats of arms were dared and achieved. A
tank led the infantry against the strongly
fortified ruins of the refinery and toppled
down everything in its path.</p>

<p class="indent">Lieut. Dick Starkley and his friends
gave ear all morning to the din of battle,
wished themselves farther forward in the
middle of it and wondered whether the
brigades in front would leave anything for
them to do on the morrow. Messages of
success came back to them from time to
time. By eight o&#39;clock, after two hours of
fighting, the Canadians had taken the
formidable trenches, the sugar refinery, a
fortified sunken road and hundreds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
prisoners. The way was open to Courcelette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If they don&#39;t slow up&mdash;if they don&#39;t
quit altogether this very minute&mdash;they&#39;ll
be crowding right in to Courcelette and
doing us out of a job!&quot; complained Sergt.
Hiram Sill. &quot;That&#39;s our job, Courcelette
is&mdash;our job for to-morrow. They&#39;ve done
what they set out to do, and if they go ahead
now and try something they haven&#39;t planned
for, well, they&#39;ll maybe bite off more
than they can chew. The psychology of
it will be all wrong; their minds aren&#39;t
made up to that idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess the idee ain&#39;t the hull thing,&quot;
remarked a middle-aged corporal. &quot;Many
a good job has been done kind of unexpectedly
in this war. I reckon this here
psychology didn&#39;t have much to do with
your D. C. M.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
&quot;That&#39;s where you&#39;re dead wrong,
Henry,&quot; said Hiram. &quot;I knew I&#39;d get a
D. C. M. all along, from the first minute I
ever set foot in a trench. My mind and
my spirit were all made up for it. I knew
I&#39;d get a D. C. M. just as sure as I know
now that I&#39;ll get a bar to it&mdash;if I don&#39;t go
west first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick, who had joined the group, laughed
and smote Hiram on the shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re dead right!&quot; he exclaimed.
&quot;Old Psychology, you&#39;re a wonder of the
age! Be careful what you make up your
heart and soul and mind to next or you&#39;ll
find yourself in command of the division.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean, lieutenant?&quot; asked
Sill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve been awarded the D. C. M.
again, that&#39;s all!&quot; cried Dick, shaking him
violently by the hand. &quot;You&#39;ve got your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
bar, Old Psychology! Word of it just
came through from the Brigade.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sergt. Sill blushed and grew pale and
blushed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, boys, I&#39;m a proud man,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are some things you can&#39;t get used
to&mdash;and being decorated for distinguished
conduct on the field of glory is one of them,
I guess. If you&#39;ll excuse me, boys,&mdash;and
you, lieutenant,&mdash;I&#39;ll just wander along that
old trench a piece and think it over by myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The way was open to Courcelette. The
battalions that had done the work in a few
hours and that, despite a terrific fire from
the enemy, had established themselves beyond
their final objective, were anxious to
continue about this business without pause
and clean up the strongly garrisoned town.
They had fought desperately in those few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
hours, however, and the enemy&#39;s fire had
taken toll of them, and so they were told to
sit tight in their new trenches; but the common
sense of their assertion that Courcelette
itself should be assaulted without loss of
time, before the beaten and astounded
enemy could recover, was admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">At half past three o&#39;clock that afternoon
the Fifth Brigade received its orders and
instructions and immediately passed them
on and elaborated them to the battalions
concerned. By five o&#39;clock the three battalions
that were to make the attack were
on their way across the open country, advancing
in waves. German guns battered
them but did not break their alignment.
They reached our new trenches and, with
the barrage of our own guns now moving
before them, passed through and over the
victorious survivors of the morning&#39;s battle.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
The French Canadians and the Nova
Scotians went first in two waves.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick Starkley and his platoon were on
the right of the front line of the 26th, which
was the third wave of attack. &quot;Mopping
up&quot; was the battalion&#39;s particular job on
this occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mopping up,&quot; like most military terms,
means considerably more than it suggests
to the ear. The mops are rifles, bombs and
bayonets; the things to be mopped are
machine-gun posts still in active operation,
bays and sections of trenches still occupied
by aggressive Germans, mined cellars and
garrisoned dugouts. Everything of a menacing
nature that the assaulting waves have
passed over or outflanked without demolishing
must be dealt with by the &quot;moppers-up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two lines of the 26th advanced at an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
easy walk; there was about five yards between
man and man. Each man carried
water and rations for forty-eight hours and
five empty sandbags, over and above his
arms and kit. The men kept their alignment
all the way up to the edge of the village.
Now and again they closed on the
center or extended to right or left to fill a
gap. Wounded men crawled into shell
holes or were picked up and carried forward.
Dead men lay sprawled beneath
their equipment, with their rifles and bayonets
out thrust toward Courcelette even in
death. The &quot;walking wounded&quot; continued
to go forward, some unconscious or unmindful
of their injuries and others trying to
bandage themselves as they walked.</p>

<p class="indent">Col. MacKenzie led them, and beside
him walked a company commander. The
two shouted to each other above the din of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
battle, and sometimes they turned and
shouted back to their men. Other officers
walked a few paces in front of their men.</p>

<p class="indent">A bursting shell threw Dick backward
into a small crater that had been made
earlier in the day and knocked the breath
out of him for a few seconds. Frank Sacobie
picked him up. The colonel gave the
signal to double, and the right flank of the
26th broke from a walk into a slow and
heavy jog. Sacobie jogged beside Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just a year since we came into the
line!&quot; shouted Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were pa&#39;tridge shootin&#39; two years
ago to-day!&quot; bawled Sacobie.</p>

<p class="indent">The colonel turned with his back to Courcelette
and his face to his men and yelled
at them to come on. &quot;Speed up on the
right!&quot; he shouted. &quot;The left is ahead.
The 25th is in already. Shake a leg, boys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
If they don&#39;t move quick enough in front,
blow right through &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the near edge of the village a number
of New Brunswickers, including their colonel,
overtook and mingled with the second
line of the 22d. Our barrage was lifted
clear of Courcelette by this time and set
like a spouting wall of fire and earth along
the far side of it; but the shells of the enemy
continued to pitch into it, heaving bricks
and rafters and the soil of little gardens into
the vibrating twilight. Machine guns
streamed their fire upon the invaders from
attics and cellars and sand-bagged windows.
The bombs and rifles of the 22d smashed
and cracked just ahead; and on the left,
still farther ahead, crashes and bangs and
shouts told all who could hear the whereabouts
of Hilliam and his lads from Nova
Scotia.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
Dick Starkley saw a darting flicker of
fire from the butt of a broken chimney beyond
a cellar full of bricks and splintered
timber. He shouted to his men, let his
pistol swing from its lanyard and threw a
bomb. Then, stooping low, he dashed at
the jumble of ruins in the cellar. He saw
his bomb burst beside the stump of chimney.
The machine gun flickered again, and
<i>spat-spat-spat</i> came quicker than thought.
Other bombs smashed in front of him, to
right and left of the chimney. He got his
right foot entangled in what had once been
a baby&#39;s crib.</p>

<p class="indent">There he was, staggering on the very
summit of that low mound of rubbish,
fairly in line with the aim of the machine
gun. Something seized him by some part
of his equipment and jerked him backward.
He lit on his back and slid a yard, then beheld
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
the face of Hiram Sill staring down at
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hit?&quot; asked Hiram.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t think so. No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a wonder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Five men from Dick&#39;s platoon joined
them in the ruins. Together they threw
seven grenades. The hidden gun ceased
fire. Dick scrambled up and over the rubbish
and around what was left of the shattered
chimney that masked the machine-gun
post. In the dim light he saw sprawled
shapes and crouching shapes, and one
stooped over the machine gun, working
swiftly to clear it again for action. Dick
pistoled the gunner. The three survivors
of that crew put up their hands. Sergt.
Sill disarmed them and told them to &quot;beat
it&quot; back to the Canadian lines. Fifty yards
on they found Sacobie and two privates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
counting prisoners at the mouth of a dugout.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty-nine without a scratch,&quot; said
Sacobie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Find stretchers for them and send them
back with our wounded, under escort,&quot;
said Dick. &quot;Put a corporal in charge. Is
there a corporal here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m here, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You, Judd? Take them back with as
many of our wounded as they can carry.
Two men with you should be escort enough.
Hand over the wounded and fetch up any
grenades and ammunition you can get hold
of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Capt. Smith staggered up to Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are through and out the other side!&quot;
he gasped. &quot;Get as many of our fellows
as you can collect quick to stiffen this flank.
Dig in beyond the houses&mdash;in line with the
25th. The colonel is up there somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
He swayed and stumbled against the platoon
commander. Dick supported him
with an arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hit?&quot; asked Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just what you&#39;d notice,&quot; said the captain,
straightening himself and reeling away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go after him and do what you can for
him,&quot; said Dick to one of his men. &quot;Bandage
him and then go look for an M. O.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick hurried on toward the forward edge
of the village, strengthening his following
as he went. The shelling was still heavy
and the noise deafening, but the hand-to-hand
fighting among the houses had lessened.
Dick led his men through one wall
of a house that had been hit by a heavy shell
and through the other wall into a little garden.
There were bricks and tiles and iron
shards in that garden; and in the middle
of it, untouched, a little arbor of grapevines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
Dick passed through the arbor on his way
to the broken wall at the foot of the garden.
There were two benches in it and a small
round table.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick went through the arbor in a second,
and then he sprang to the broken crest of
the wall. He had scarcely mounted upon
it before something red burst close in front
of his eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Dick was not astonished to find himself
in the old garden at Beaver Dam. The
lilacs were in flower and full of bees and
butterflies. He still wore his shrapnel helmet.
It felt very uncomfortable, and he
tried to take it off&mdash;but it stuck fast to his
head. Even that did not astonish him. He
saw an arbor of grapevines and entered it
and sat down on a bench with his elbows
on a small round table. He recognized it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
as the arbor he had seen that evening in
Courcelette&mdash;the evening of September 15.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must have brought it home with
me,&quot; he reflected. &quot;The war must be
over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flora entered the arbor then and asked
him why he was wearing an officer&#39;s jacket.
He thought it queer that she had not heard
about his commission.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was promoted on the Somme&mdash;no, it
was before that,&quot; he began, and then everything
became dark. &quot;I can&#39;t see,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; replied a
voice that was not Flora&#39;s. &quot;Your eyes are
bandaged for the time being. They&#39;ll be
as well as ever in a few days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must have been dreaming. Where am
I&mdash;and what is wrong with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are in No. 2 Canadian General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
Hospital and have been dreaming for almost
a week. But you are doing very
well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What hit me? And have I all my legs
and arms?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must have been a whiz-bang,&quot; replied
the unknown voice. &quot;You are suffering
from head wounds that are not so
serious as we feared and from broken ribs
and a few cuts and gashes. You must
drink this and stop talking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick obediently drank it, whatever it
was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you could give me some news
of the battalion, and then I&#39;d keep quiet for
a long time,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want me to open and read this
letter that your brother left for you two
days ago?&quot; asked the Sister.</p>

<p class="indent">She read as follows:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
&quot;Dear Dick. As your temperature is up
and you refuse to know me I am leaving
this note for you with the charming Sister
who seems to be your C. O. just now. She
tells me that you will be as fit as a fiddle in
a month or so. Accept my congratulations
on your escape and on the battle of Courcelette.
I have written to Beaver Dam
about it and cabled that you will live to
fight again. Frank Sacobie and that psychological
sergeant with a D. C. M. and
bar are booked for Blighty, to polish up
for their commissions. I called on them
after the fight. They are well&mdash;but I can&#39;t
say that they escaped without a scratch, for
they both looked as if they had been mixing
it up with a bunch of wildcats. Sacobie
has a black eye and doesn&#39;t know who or
what hit him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember Jim Hammond? He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
came over to a battalion of this division with
a draft from England about four months
ago. He looked me up one day last week
and told me a mighty queer story about
himself. I won&#39;t try to repeat it, for I am
sure he&#39;ll tell it to you himself at the first
opportunity. He is making good, as far
as I can see and hear. Pat Hammond has
a job in London now. He was badly gassed
about a month ago. I will get another
day&#39;s special leave as soon as possible and
pay you another visit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your affectionate brother, Henry Starkley.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chIX" id="chIX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>FRANK SACOBIE OBJECTS</small></h2>

<p class="indent">WITHIN ten days of the battle of
Courcelette, Lieut. Richard
Starkley was able to see; and
twenty days after that he was able to walk.
His walking at first was an extraordinary
thing, and extraordinary was the amount
of pleasure that he derived from it. With
a crutch under one shoulder and Sister Gilbert
under the other, bandaged and padded
from hip to neck, and with his battered
but entire legs wavering beneath him, he
crossed the ward that first day without exceeding
the speed limit. Brother officers
in various stages of repair did not refrain
from expressing their opinions of his performance.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
&quot;Try to be back for tea, old son,&quot; said a
New Zealand major.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are those your legs or mine you&#39;re fox-trotting
with?&quot; asked an English subaltern;
and an elderly colonel called, &quot;I&#39;ll hop out
and show you how to walk in a minute, if
you don&#39;t do better than that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The colonel laughed, and the inmates of
the other beds laughed, and Dick and
Sister Gilbert laughed, for that, you must
know, was a very good joke. The humor
of the remark lay in the fact that the elderly
colonel had not a leg to his name.</p>

<p class="indent">Day by day Dick improved in pace and
gait, and his activities inspired a number of
his companions to shake an uncertain leg
or two. The elderly colonel organized
contests; and the great free-for-all race
twice round the ward was one of the notable
sporting events of the war.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
At last Dick was shipped to Blighty and
admitted to a hospital for convalescent
Canadian officers. There Capt. J. A.
Starkley-Davenport soon found him. No
change that the eye could detect had taken
place in Jack Davenport. His face was
as thin and colorless as when Dick had first
seen it; his eyes were just as bright, and
their glances as kindly and intent; his body
was as frail and as immaculately garbed.
Dick wondered how one so frail could
exist a week without either breaking utterly
or gaining in strength.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a wonder, Dick!&quot; exclaimed
Davenport.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It strikes me that you are the wonder,&quot;
said Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they tell me that you stopped a
whiz-bang and will be as fit as ever, nerve
and body, in a little while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;I stopped bits of it&mdash;but I don&#39;t think
it actually detonated on me. All I got was
some of the splash. I was lucky!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were indeed,&quot; said the other, with
a shadow in his eyes. &quot;I was lucky, too&mdash;though
there have been times when I have
been fool enough to wish that I had been
left on the field.&quot; Then he straightened
his thin shoulders and laughed quietly.
&quot;But if I had gone west I should have
missed Frank Sacobie and Hiram Sill.
They lunched with me last week and have
promised to turn up on Sunday. You&#39;ll be
right for Sunday, Dick, and I&#39;ll have a
pucka party in your honor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are they, and what are they up to?&quot;
asked Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are at the top of their form, both
of them, and up to anything,&quot; replied
Davenport. &quot;Your Canadian cadet course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
is the stiffest thing of its kind in England,
but it doesn&#39;t seem to bother those two.
Frank is smarter than anything the Guards
can show and is believed to be a rajah;
and Hiram writes letters to Washington
urging the formation of an American division
to be attached to the Canadian Corps
and suggesting his appointment to the command
of one of the brigades.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those letters must amuse the censors,&quot;
said Dick with a grin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I imagine they do. Washington hasn&#39;t
answered yet; and so Hiram is getting his
dander up and is pitching each letter a little
higher than the one before it. Incidentally,
he has a great deal to say to our War
Office, and his novel suggestions for developing
trench warfare seem to have awakened
a variety of emotions in the brains and
livers of a lot of worthy <i>brass hats</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
Dick laughed. &quot;What are his ideas for
developing trench warfare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One is the organization of a shot-gun
platoon in every battalion. The weapon is
to be the duck gun, number eight bore, I
believe. Hiram maintains that, used
within a range of one hundred and fifty
yards, those weapons would be superior to
any in repulsing attacks in mass and in
cleaning up raided trenches. He is a great
believer in the deadly and demoralizing
effects of point-blank fire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is right in that&mdash;once you get rid of
the parapet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He gets rid of the parapet with the
point-blank fire of what he calls trench cannon&mdash;guns,
three feet long, mounted so that
they can be carried along a trench by
four men; they are to fire ten- or twelve-pound
high explosive shells from the front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
line smack against the opposite parapet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It sounds right, too; but so many things
sound right that work all wrong. What
are his other schemes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One has to do with a thundering big six-hooked
grapnel, with a wire cable attached,
that is to be shot into the hostile lines from
a big trench mortar and then winched back
by steam. He expects his grapnel&mdash;give
him power enough&mdash;to tear out trenches,
machine-gun posts and battalion headquarters,
and bring home all sorts of odds
and ends of value for identification purposes.
Can&#39;t you see the brigadier stepping
out before brekker to take a look at
the night&#39;s haul?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My hat! What did the War Office
think of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An acting assistant something or other
of the name of Smythers and the rank of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
major was inspired by it to ask Hiram
whether he had ever served in France.
Hiram put over a twenty-page narrative
of his exploits with the battalion, with appendixes
of maps and notes and extracts
from brigade and battalion orders, and, so
far as I know, the major has not yet recovered
sufficiently to retaliate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I hope Frank Sacobie has left the
War Office alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frank writes nothing and says very
little more than that. He seems to give all
his attention to his kit; but I have a suspicion
that he is a deep thinker. However
that may be, his taste in dress is astonishingly
good, and his deportment in society
is in as good taste as his breeches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he has a good time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is very gay when he comes up to
town,&quot; answered Davenport.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
&quot;He deserves a good time, but he can&#39;t
get it and at the same time doll himself up,
even in uniform, on his pay. How does
he do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have guessed it, Dick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then there is no need of my saying much
about it. I live on one sixth of my income.
That leaves five sixths for my friends; and
often, Dick, it is the thought of the spending
of the five parts that gives me courage
to go on keeping life in this useless body
with the one part. Sometimes a soldier&#39;s
wife buys food for herself and children, or
pays the rent, with my money; and the lion&#39;s
share of the pleasure of that transaction
is mine. Sometimes a chap on leave spends
a fistful of my treasury notes on dinners for
himself and his girl; and those dinners give
me more pleasure than the ones I eat myself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
I haven&#39;t much of a stomach of my
own now, you know; and I haven&#39;t a girl
of my own to take out to one&mdash;even if Wilson
would let me go out at night. It is not
charity. I satisfy my own lost hunger for
food through the medium of poor people
with good appetites: I have my fun and
cut a dash in new breeches and swagger
service jackets through the medium of hard
fighting fellows from France. I am not
apologizing, you understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You needn&#39;t,&quot; said Dick dryly; and then
they both laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram Sill and Frank Sacobie called on
Dick at the hospital soon after ten o&#39;clock
on Sunday morning. They had come up
to town the evening before. The greetings
of the three friends were warm. Sacobie&#39;s
pleasure at the reunion found no voice, but
shone in his eyes and thrilled in the grip of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
his hand. Hiram Sill added words to the
message of his beaming face. He expressed
delighted amazement at Dick&#39;s appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t quite believe it until now,&quot;
he said. &quot;Neither could you if you had
seen yourself as we saw you when you were
picked up. Nothing the matter with your
face, except a dimple or two that you
weren&#39;t born with. All your legs and arms
still your own. I&#39;d sooner see this than a
letter from Washington. With your luck
you&#39;ll live to command the battalion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick grinned. His greetings to his
friends had been as boyishly impulsive and
cheery as ever; yet there was something
looking out through the affection in his eyes
that would have puzzled his people in New
Brunswick if they had seen it. There was
a question in the look and a hint of anxiety
and perhaps the faintest shade of the airs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
of a fond father, a sympathetic judge and
a hopeful appraiser. Frank and Hiram
recognized and accepted it without thought
or question. The look was nothing more
than the shadow of the habit of responsibility
and command.</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram talked about Washington and the
War Office, and discussed his grapnel idea
with considerable heat. Frank Sacobie
took no part in that discussion and little in
the general conversation. Soon after twelve
o&#39;clock all three set out in a taxicab for
Jack Davenport&#39;s house.</p>

<p class="indent">The luncheon was successful. The other
guests were three women&mdash;a cousin of
Jack&#39;s on the Davenport side and her two
daughters. The host and Hiram Sill both
conversed brilliantly. Frank was inspired
to make at least five separate remarks of
some half dozen words each. Dick soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
let the drift of the general conversation
escape him, so interested did he become in
the girl on his right.</p>

<p class="indent">Kathleen Kingston seemed to him a
strange mixture of shyness and self-possession,
of calmness and vivacity. The coloring
of her small face was wonderfully mobile&mdash;so
Dick expressed it to himself&mdash;and
yet her eyes were frank, steady and unembarrassed.
Her voice was curiously low
and clear.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick was conscious of feeling a vague
and unsteady wonder at himself. Why
this sudden interest in a girl? He had
never felt anything of the kind before.
Had this something to do with the wounds
in his head? He could not entertain that
suggestion seriously. However that might
be, he felt that his sudden interest in this
young person whom he had not so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
as heard of an hour ago greatly increased
his interest in many things. He was conscious
of a sure friendship for her, as if he
had known her for years. He knew that
this friendship was a more important thing
to him than his friendships with Hiram Sill
and Frank Sacobie&mdash;and yet those friendships
had grown day by day, strengthened
week by week and stood the test of suffering
and peril.</p>

<p class="indent">She told him that her father was still in
France, but safe now at General Headquarters,
that her eldest brother had been
killed in action in 1914, that another was
fighting in the East, and that still another
was a midshipman on the North Sea.
Also, she told him that she wanted to go
to France as a V. A. D., that she had left
school six months ago and was working five
hours every day making bandages and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
splints, and that she was seventeen years
old. Those confidences melted Dick&#39;s
tongue. He told her his own age and that
he had added a little to it at the time of
enlisting; he spoke of night and daylight
raids and major offensive operations in
which he had taken part, of the military
careers of Henry and Peter and of life at
Beaver Dam. She seemed to be as keenly
interested in his confidences as he had been
in hers. In the library, where coffee was
served, Dick continued to cling to his new
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">The party came to an end at last, leaving
Dick in a somewhat scattered state of
mind. Before leaving with her daughters,
Mrs. Kingston gave her address and a cordial
invitation to make use of it to each of
the three. Before long Wilson took Jack
off to bed. Then Hiram left to keep an appointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
at the Royal Automobile Club
with a captain who knew some one at the
War Office. That left Frank and Dick
with Jack Davenport&#39;s library to themselves.
One place was much the same as
another to Dick just then. He was again
wondering if he could possibly be suffering
in some subtle and painless way from the
wounds in his head. With enquiring fingers
he felt the spotless bandage that still
adorned the top of his head.</p>

<p class="indent">Sacobie got out of his chair suddenly,
with an abruptness of movement that was
foreign to him, and walked the length of
the room and back. He halted before Dick
and stared down at him keenly for several
seconds without attracting that battered
youth&#39;s attention. So he fell again to pacing
the room, walking lightly and with
straight feet, the true Indian walk. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
last he halted again in front of Dick&#39;s
chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going back to the battalion,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick sat up with a jerk and stared at
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going back,&quot; repeated Sacobie.
&quot;I shall get my commission, that is sure;
but I shall not be an officer in the battalion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why the mischief not?&quot; exclaimed
Dick. &quot;What&#39;s the matter with the battalion,
I&#39;d like to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied the other. He moved
away a few paces, then turned back again.
&quot;A good battalion. I was a good sergeant
there. But I met Capt. Dodds, on leave,
one day, and we had lunch together at
Scott&#39;s; and he feel pretty good&mdash;he felt
pretty good&mdash;and he talked a lot. He told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
me how some officers and other ranks say
the colonel didn&#39;t do right when he put in
my name for cadet course and a commission.
You know why, Dick. So I don&#39;t
go back to the infantry with my two stars.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean because you are an Indian?
That is rot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it is good sense. You think about
it hard as I have thought about it day and
night. They don&#39;t say I don&#39;t know my
job. The captain told me the colonel was
right and everybody knew it when he said
I should make the best scout officer in the
brigade; and the men like me, you know
that; but the men don&#39;t want an Injun for
an officer. They are white men. I am a
Malecite&mdash;red. That is right. I don&#39;t go
back with my officer stars.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean that you won&#39;t take your
commission?&quot; asked Dick.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
&quot;No. I take it, sure. But not in the
26th.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick did not argue. He had never considered
his friend&#39;s case in that light before,
but now he knew that Sacobie was right.
The noncommissioned officers and men
would not question Frank&#39;s military qualifications,
his ability or his personal merits.
His race was the only thing about him to
which they objected&mdash;and that appeared
objectionable in him only when they considered
him as an officer. As a &quot;non-com&quot;
he was one of themselves, but as an officer
they must consider him impersonally as a
superior. There was where the New
Brunswick soldiers would cease to consider
their friend and comrade Frank Sacobie
and see only a member of an inferior race.
Their point of view would immediately
revert to that of the old days before the war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
when they would have laughed at a Malecite&#39;s
undertaking to perform any task except
paddling a canoe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you transfer to another battalion?&quot;
asked Dick, as a result of his reflections.</p>

<p class="indent">Frank shook his head but made no reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then to an English battalion?&quot; Dick
persisted. &quot;There are dozens that would
be glad to have you, Frank. A Canadian
with your record would not have to look
far for a job in this war. Jack Davenport&#39;s
old regiment would snap you up
quick as a wink, commission and all, I bet
a dollar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other smiled gravely. &quot;That is
right,&quot; he said. &quot;Capt. Davenport is my
friend and knows what I am; but most English
people want me to be some kind of
prince from India. I am myself&mdash;a Canadian
soldier. I don&#39;t want to play the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
monkey. Two-Blanket Sacobie was a big
chief, with his salmon spear and sometimes
nothing to eat. His squaw chopped the
wood and carried the water. I am not a
prince, nor I&#39;m not a monkey. I come to
the war, and the English people call me
rajah; but the Englishman come to our
country and hire me for a guide in the
woods and call me a nigger. No, I am
myself with what good I have in me. I
can do to fight the Germans, and that is all
I want, Dick. I try to be a gentleman, like
Peter and Capt. Davenport, and the King
will make me an officer. That is good.
I will join the Royal Flying Corps. Then
they will name me for what I am by what
I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick gripped Frank&#39;s right hand in a
hearty clasp of respect and admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a brick!&quot; he said. &quot;Jack was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
right when he said you were a deep thinker.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got to think deep&mdash;deeper than you,&quot;
said Frank. &quot;I got to think all for myself,
because my fathers didn&#39;t think at all.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chX" id="chX"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>DICK OBLIGES HIS FRIEND</small></h2>

<p class="indent">BOTH Hiram Sill and Frank Sacobie
completed the cadet course and
passed the final examinations.
After one last fling at Washington and one
more astounding suggestion to the War
Office, Mr. Sill went back to France and
his battalion and took command of a platoon.
Mr. Sacobie transferred, with his
new rank, to the Royal Flying Corps and
immediately began another course of instruction.
His brother officers decided
that he was of a family of Italian origin.
He did not bother his head about what they
thought and applied himself with fervor
to mastering the science of flying.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick recovered his strength steadily. He
saw Davenport frequently and the Kingstons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
still more frequently. His friendship
with the Kingstons&mdash;particularly with
Kathleen&mdash;deepened without a check. No
two days ever went by consecutively without
his seeing one or another of that family&mdash;usually
one.</p>

<p class="indent">On a certain Tuesday morning near the
end of November he left the hospital at ten
o&#39;clock in high spirits. He had that morning
discarded his last crutch and now moved
along with the help of two big sticks. The
dressing on his head was reduced to one
thin strip of linen bound smoothly round
just above the line of his eyebrows. It
showed beneath his cap and gave him
somewhat the air of a cheerful brigand.
Though his left foot came into contact with
the pavement very gingerly, he twirled one
of the heavy sticks airily every now and
again.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
Dick found Jack Davenport in the library.
A woman and two little girls were
leaving the library as he entered. The
woman was poorly dressed, and her eyelids
were red from recent tears&mdash;but now
a look of relief, almost of joy, shone in her
eyes. She turned on the threshold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bill will have more heart now, sir, for
the fighting of his troubles and miseries over
there,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were to stand and
talk an hour, sir, I couldn&#39;t tell you what&#39;s
in my heart&mdash;but I say again, God bless
you for your great kindness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned again then and passed Dick,
and the butler opened the big door and
bowed her out of the house with an air of
cheery good will.</p>

<p class="indent">Capt. Starkley-Davenport sat with his
crutch and stick leaning against the table.
On the cloth within easy reach his check
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
book lay open before him. He was dressed
with his usual completeness of detail and
studied simplicity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been boarded yet?&quot; asked
Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow,&quot; replied Dick. &quot;All the
M. O.&#39;s are friends of mine, so I expect
to wangle back to my battalion in two
weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack smiled and shook his head. &quot;Your
best friend in the world&mdash;or the maddest
doctor in the army&mdash;wouldn&#39;t send you
back to France on one leg, old son. Six
weeks is nearer the mark.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can make it in two. You watch me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And is it still your old battalion, Dick?
I have refrained from worrying you about
it this time, because you deserved a rest&mdash;but
I&#39;m keener than ever to see you in my
old outfit; and your third pip is there for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
you to put up on the very day of your
transfer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it, Jack&mdash;and
of course I&#39;d like to do it because you want
me to. But the colonel wouldn&#39;t understand.
No one who does not know you
would understand. People would think I&#39;d
done it for the step, or that I hadn&#39;t hit it
off, as an officer, with the old crowd. I
want to stay, and yet I want to go. I want
to fight on, as far as my luck will take me,
with the 26th, and yet I&#39;d be proud as a
brigadier to sport three pips with your lot.
As for doing something that you want me
to do&mdash;why, to be quite frank with you,
there isn&#39;t another man in the world I&#39;d
sooner please than you. Give me a few
months more in which to decide. Give me
until my next leave from France.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick had become embarrassed toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
end of his speech, and now he looked at
Davenport with a red face. The other returned
the glance with a flush on his thin
cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless you, Dick,&quot; he said and looked
away. &quot;Your next leave from France,&quot; he
continued. &quot;Six or seven months from
now, with luck. They don&#39;t give me
much more than that.&quot; Dick stared at his
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had to send for an M. O. early this
morning,&quot; Jack went on in a level voice.
&quot;Wilson did it; he heard me fussing about.
By seven o&#39;clock there were three of the
wisest looking me over&mdash;all three familiar
with my case ever since I got out of hospital.
They can&#39;t do anything, for everything that
could be removed&mdash;German metal&mdash;was
dug out long ago. A few odds and ends
remain, here and there&mdash;and one or another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
of those is bound to get me within ten
or twelve months. So it will read
in the <i>Times</i> as &#39;Died of wounds,&#39; after
all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick&#39;s face turned white. &quot;Are you
joking?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not I, old son,&quot; said the captain, smiling.
&quot;I have a sense of humor&mdash;but it
doesn&#39;t run quite to that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And here you are all dolled up in white
spats! Jack, you have a giant&#39;s heart!
And worrying about me and your regiment!
Jack, I&#39;ll do it! I&#39;ll transfer. I&#39;ll put in
my application to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I like your suggestion better.
Wait till your next leave from France. I
have taken a fancy to that idea. You&#39;ll
come home in six or seven months, and you&#39;ll
ask me to let you put off your decision until
you return again. Of course I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
have to say yes&mdash;and, since I am determined
to see the Essex badges on you, I&#39;ll
wait another six or seven months. I am
stubborn. Between your indecision and my
stubbornness, the chances are that I&#39;ll fool
the doctors. That would be a joke, if you
like!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick hobbled round the table and grasped
Jack&#39;s hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Done!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I am with you,
Jack. We&#39;ll play that game for all it is
worth. But you didn&#39;t seriously believe
what the doctors said, did you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, until five minutes ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two years ago they said you would be
right as wheat in six months; and now they
say you will be dead in a year. If they
think they&#39;re prophets&mdash;they are clean off
their job. Would they bet money on it?
I don&#39;t think! One year! Fifty years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
would have sounded almost as knowing and
a good sight more likely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick stayed to luncheon, and he remained
at the table after Wilson had taken
Jack away to lie down. Wilson came back
within fifteen minutes and found the
Canadian subaltern where he had left
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir, I am anxious about Capt. Jack,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; asked Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir Peter Bayle and two other medical
gentlemen of the highest standing warned
him this very morning, sir, that he was only
one year more for this world; and now he
is singing, sir,&mdash;a thing he has not done in
months,&mdash;and a song which runs, sir, with
your permission, &#39;All the boys and girls I
chance to meet say, Who&#39;s that coming
down the street? Why, it&#39;s Milly; she&#39;s a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
daisy&#39;&mdash;and so on, sir. I fear his wounds
have affected his mind, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilson, I know that song and approve
of it,&quot; said Dick. &quot;If Sir Peter Bayle told
you, in November, 1916, that you were to
die in November, 1917, of wounds received
in 1914, should you worry? Nix to that!
You would seriously suspect that Sir Peter
had his diagnosis of your case mixed up in
his high-priced noddle with Buchan&#39;s History
of the War; and if you are the man I
think you are, you, too, would sing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you, Mr. Richard. You fill
my heart with courage, sir,&quot; said Wilson.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick reached the Kingston house at four
o&#39;clock and was shown as usual into the
drawing-room. The ladies were not there,
but an officer whom Dick had never seen
before stood on the hearthrug with his back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
to the fire. He wore the crown and star
of a lieutenant colonel on his shoulders, a
wound stripe on his left sleeve, the red tabs
of the general staff on his collar, on his
right breast the blue ribbon of the Royal
Humane Society&#39;s medal and on his left
breast the ribbons of the D. S. O., of the
Queen&#39;s and the King&#39;s South African
medals, of several Indian medals and of
the Legion of Honor. His figure was
slight and of little more than the medium
height. A monocle without a cord shone
in his right eye, and his air was amiable
and alert. Dick halted on his two sticks
and said, &quot;I beg your pardon, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other flashed a smile, advanced
quickly and in two motions put Dick into
a deep chair and took possession of the
sticks. Then he shook the visitor&#39;s hand
heartily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
&quot;Glad to see you,&quot; he said. &quot;There is
no mistaking you. You are Kathleen&#39;s
Canadian subaltern. I am Kathleen&#39;s
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dick knew that there were plenty of
suitable things to say in reply, but for the
life of him he could not think of one of
them. So he said nothing, but returned
the colonel&#39;s smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be bashful, Dick,&quot; continued the
other. &quot;I was a boy myself not so long ago
as you think&mdash;but I hadn&#39;t seen a shot fired
in anger when I was your age. It&#39;s amazing.
I wonder what weight of metal has
gone over your head, not to mention what
has hit you and fallen short. Tons and
tons, I suppose. It&#39;s an astounding war, to
my mind. Don&#39;t you find it so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are right,&quot; continued the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;I wish I were your age, so as to see it more
clearly. Stupendous!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment Mrs. Kingston and the
two girls entered. It had been Dick&#39;s and
Kathleen&#39;s intention to go out to tea; but
the colonel upset that plan by saying that
he was very anxious to hear Dick talk. So
they remained at home for tea&mdash;and the
colonel did all the talking. Dick agreed
with everything he said about the war, however,
and then he said that Dick was right&mdash;so
it really made no difference after
all which of them actually said the
things.</p>

<p class="indent">During the ten days of the colonel&#39;s
leave he and Dick became firm friends.
They knocked about town together every
morning, often lunched with Jack Davenport
and every afternoon and evening took
Mrs. Kingston and the girls out. Dick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
dined at home with the family on the colonel&#39;s
last night of leave. After dinner,
when the others left the table, the colonel
detained Dick with a wink.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t keep you from Kathleen ten
minutes, my boy,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to tell
you, in case I don&#39;t see you again for a long
time,&mdash;meetings between soldiers are uncertain
things, Dick,&mdash;that this little affair
between you and my daughter has done me
good to see. You are both babies, so don&#39;t
take it too seriously. Take it happily.
Whatever may happen in the future, you
two children will have something very
beautiful and romantic and innocent to look
back at in this war. Though you should
live to be ninety and marry a girl from Assiniboia,
yet you will always remember this
old town with pleasure. If, on the other
hand, you should continue in your present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
vein&mdash;that is, continue to feel like this after
you grow up&mdash;that it is absolutely necessary
to your happiness to have tea with my
daughter every day&mdash;well, good luck to
you! I can&#39;t say more than that, my boy.
But in the meantime, be happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he shook Dick vigorously by the
hand, patted his shoulder and pushed him
out of the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick handled the medical officers so ably
that he and his transportation were ready
for France on New Year&#39;s Day. The
Kingstons saw him off. He found a seat
in a first-class compartment and deposited
his haversack in it. Then the four stood
on the platform and tried in vain to think
of something to say. Even Mrs. Kingston
was silent. Officers of all ranks of
every branch of the service, with their
friends and relatives, crowded the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
platform. Late arrivals bundled in and
out of the carriages, looking for unclaimed
seats. Guards looked at their big silver
watches and requested the gentlemen to take
their seats. Then Mrs. Kingston kissed
Dick; then Mary kissed him; and then,
lifted to a state of recklessness, he kissed
Kathleen on her trembling lips. He saw
tears quivering in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I come back&mdash;next leave&mdash;will it
be the same?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">She bowed her head, and the tears spilled
over and glistened on her cheeks. Standing
in the doorway of the compartment,
Dick saluted, then turned, trod on the toes
of a sapper major, moved heavily from
there to the spurred boots of an artillery
colonel and sat down violently and blindly
on his lumpy haversack. The five other
occupants of the compartment glanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
from Dick to the group on the platform.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 502px;">
<a name="i259" id="i259"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i259.jpg" width="502" height="699" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE COMPARTMENT,
DICK SALUTED.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;We all know it&#39;s a rotten war, old son,&quot;
said the gunner colonel and, stooping, rubbed
the toes of his outraged boots with his
gloves.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick found many old faces replaced by
new in the battalion. Enemy snipers, shell
fire, sickness and promotion had been at
work. Dick acted as assistant adjutant for
a couple of weeks and was then posted to
a company as second in command and
promised his step in rank at the earliest
opportunity. In the same company was
Lieut. Hiram Sill&#39;s platoon. Hiram, busy
as ever, had distinguished himself several
times since his return and was in a fair
way to be recommended for a Military
Cross.</p>

<p class="indent">The commander of the company was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
middle-aged, amiable person who had been
worked so hard during the past year that he
had nothing left to carry on with except
courage. At sight of Dick he rejoiced, for
Dick had a big reputation. He took off
his boots and belt, retired to his blankets and
told his batman to wake him when the war
was over. The relief was too much for
him; it had come too late. The more he
rested the worse he felt, and at last the
medical officer sent him out on a stretcher.
Fever and a general breakdown held him
at the base for several weeks, and then he
was shipped to Blighty. So Dick got
a company and his third star, and no
one begrudged him the one or the
other.</p>

<p class="indent">The Canadian Corps worked all winter
in preparation for its great spring task.
The Germans fortified and intrenched and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
mightily garrisoned along all the great
ridge of Vimy, harassed the preparing
legions with shells and bombs and looked
contemptuously out and down upon us from
their strong vantage points. Others had
failed to wrest Vimy from them. But
night and day the Canadians went on with
their preparations.</p>

<p class="indent">Word that the United States of America
had declared war on Germany reached the
toilers before Vimy on April 7; and within
the week there came a night of gunfire that
rocked the earth and tore the air. With
morning the gunfire ceased, only to break
forth again in lesser volume as the jumping
barrages were laid along the ridge; and
then, in a storm of wind and snow, the battalions
went over on a five-division front,
company after company, wave after wave,
riflemen, bombers and Lewis gunners. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
Canadians were striking after their winter
of drudgery.</p>

<p class="indent">One of our men, a Yankee by birth, went
over that morning with a miniature Stars
and Stripes tied to his bayonet. We
cleared out the Huns and took the ridge;
and for days the water that filled the shell
holes and mine craters over that ground
was red with Canadian blood, and the plank
roads were slippery with it from the passing
of our wounded.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick went through that fight in front of
his company and came out of it speechless
with exhaustion, but unhit. Hiram Sill
survived it with his arm in a sling. Maj.
Henry Starkley was wounded again, again
not seriously. Maj. Patrick Hammond was
killed, and Corp. Jim Hammond was carried
back the next day with a torn scalp and
a crushed knee.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
On the tenth day after that battle Lieut.
Hiram Sill and his company commander
were the recipients of extraordinary news.
Mr. Sill was requested to visit the colonel
without loss of time. He turned up within
the minute and saluted with his left
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wanted back in the U. S. A.,
Hiram, for instructional purposes,&quot; said the
colonel, looking over a mess of papers at his
elbow. &quot;You don&#39;t have to go if you don&#39;t
want to. Here it is&mdash;and to be made out
in triplicate, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram examined the papers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And here is something else that will interest
you,&quot; continued the colonel. &quot;News
for you and Dick Starkley. You have your
M. C.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram&#39;s eyes shone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Dick seems to have hooked the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
same for his work on the Somme&mdash;and I
had given up all hope of that coming
through. I recommended him for a D. S.
O. last week. The way these recommendations
for awards are handled beats me.
They put them all into a hat and then
chuck the hat out of the window, I guess,
and whatever recommendations are picked
up in the street and returned through the
post are approved and acted upon. I know
a chap&mdash;come back here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram turned at the door of the hut.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you intend to accept that job?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have a choice between going over
to the American army with your rank or
simply being seconded from the Canadians
for that duty. What do you mean
to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seconded, sir. I am an American citizen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
clear through, colonel, but I have worn
this cut of uniform too long to change it in
this war.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram found Dick in his billet, reading
a letter. Dick received the news of the
awards and of Hiram&#39;s appointment very
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jack Davenport has gone west,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram sat down and stared at Dick without
a word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This letter is from Kathleen,&quot; continued
Dick. &quot;She says Jack went out on Monday
to visit some of the people he helps.
He had taken on six more widows and seven
more babies since the Vimy show. On his
way home toward evening he and Wilson
were outside the Blackfriars underground
station, looking for a taxi, when a lorry took
a skid fair at an old woman and little boy
who were just making the curb. Wilson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
swears that Jack jumped from the curb as
if there were nothing wrong with him,
landed fair in front of the lorry, knocked
the old woman and kid out from under, but
fell before he could get clear himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Killed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Instantly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram gazed down at his muddy boots,
and Dick continued to regard the letter in
his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you beat it?&quot; said Hiram at last.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick got up and paced about the little
room, busy with his thoughts. Finally he
spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sacobie is flying, and you are booked for
the States, and I am going to transfer to
Jack&#39;s old lot,&quot; he said slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hiram looked up at him, but did not
speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jack wanted me to,&quot; continued Dick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
&quot;Well, why not? It&#39;s the same old army
and the same old war. A fellow should
make an effort to oblige a man like Jack&mdash;dead
or alive.&quot; He was silent for several
seconds, then went on: &quot;Henry has been
offered a staff job in London. Peter is safe.
Sacobie has brought down four Boche
machines already. What have you heard
about Jim Hammond?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s Blighty for him&mdash;and then Canada.
He&#39;ll never in the world bend that leg
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a while Dick continued to pace back
and forth across the muddy floor in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are scattering, Old Psychology,&quot; he
said. &quot;This war is a great scatterer&mdash;but
there are some things it can&#39;t touch. You&#39;ll
be homesick at your new job, Hiram,&mdash;and
I&#39;ll be homesick with the Essex bunch, I
suppose,&mdash;but there are some things that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
make it all seem worth the rotten misery of
it.&quot; He glanced down at Kathleen&#39;s letter,
then put it into his pocket. &quot;Jack Davenport,
for one,&quot; he ended.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A soldier and a gentlemen,&quot; said Hiram.</p>

<p class="center">THE END</p>
